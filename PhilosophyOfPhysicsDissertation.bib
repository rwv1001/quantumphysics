Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 150402 (2012); arXiv:1208.4123) argued that "no
alternative theory compatible with quantum theory and satisfying the freedom of
choice assumption can give improved predictions". We give a more precise
version of the formulation and proof of this remarkable claim. Our proof
broadly follows theirs, which relies on physically well motivated axioms, but
to fill in some crucial details certain technical assumptions have had to be
added, whose physical status seems somewhat obscure.},

This book provides an in-depth and wide-ranging introduction to the subject, emphasizing throughout the basic principles and their applications. The book begins by developing the basic tools of quantum optics, and goes on to show the application of these tools in a variety of quantum optical systems, including lasing without inversion, squeezed states and atom optics. The final four chapters are devoted to a discussion of quantum optical tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics, and to particular aspects of measurement theory. Assuming only a background of standard quantum mechanics and electromagnetic theory, and containing many problems and references, this book will be invaluable to graduate students of quantum optics, as well as to researchers in this field.},

We argue that a point-like atom serves as the archetype for both the creation and detection of photons. Spontaneous emission from atoms provides a spatially localized source of photon states that serves as a natural wave packet basis for quantum states of light. Photodetection theory allows us to give operational meaning to the photon wave function which, for single photons, is analogous to the electric field in classical wave optics. Entanglement between photons, and the uniquely quantum phenomena that result from it, are exemplified by two-photon wave functions.},

@article{LeegwaterGijs2016Aitf,
issn = {1355-2198},
abstract = {Recently, Roger Colbeck and Renato Renner (C&R) have claimed that ‘[n]o extension of quantum theory can have improved predictive power’ (Colbeck & Renner, 2011, 2012b). If correct, this is a spectacular impossibility theorem for hidden-variable theories, which is more general than the theorems of Bell (1964) and Leggett (2003). Also, C&R have used their claim in attempt to prove that a system׳s quantum-mechanical wave function is in a one-to-one correspondence with its ‘ontic’ state (Colbeck & Renner, 2012a). C&R׳s claim essentially means that in any hidden-variable theory that is compatible with quantum-mechanical predictions, probabilities of measurement outcomes are independent of these hidden variables. This makes such variables otiose. On closer inspection, however, the generality and validity of the claim can be contested. First, it is based on an assumption called ‘Freedom of Choice’. As the name suggests, this assumption involves the independence of an experimenter׳s choice of measurement settings. But in the way C&R define this assumption, a no-signalling condition is surreptitiously presupposed, making the assumption less innocent than it sounds. When using this definition, any hidden-variable theory violating parameter independence, such as Bohmian Mechanics, is immediately shown to be incompatible with quantum-mechanical predictions. Also, the argument of C&R is hard to follow, and their mathematical derivation contains several gaps, some of which cannot be closed in the way they suggest. We shall show that these gaps can be filled. The issue with the ‘Freedom of Choice’ assumption can be circumvented by explicitly assuming parameter independence. This makes the result less general, but better founded. We then obtain an impossibility theorem for hidden-variable theories satisfying parameter independence only. As stated above, such hidden-variable theories are impossible in the sense that any supplemental variables have no bearing on outcome probabilities, and are therefore trivial. So, while quantum mechanics itself satisfies parameter independence, if a variable is added that changes the outcome probabilities, however slightly, parameter independence must be violated.
•A no-go theorem is presented for parameter independent hidden-variable theories.•Simpler proofs of existing results related to chained Bell inequalities are included.•The work is based on a no-go theorem by Roger Colbeck and Renato Renner.•Shortcomings of Colbeck and Renner׳s work are addressed.•This work aims to be mathematically thorough and contains some new, necessary steps.},

abstract = {According to quantum theory, measurements generate random outcomes, in stark contrast with classical mechanics. This raises the question of whether there could exist an extension of the theory that removes this indeterminism, as suspected by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. Although this has been shown to be impossible, existing results do not imply that the current theory is maximally informative. Here we ask the more general question of whether any improved predictions can be achieved by any extension of quantum theory. Under the assumption that measurements can be chosen freely, we answer this question in the negative: no extension of quantum theory can give more information about the outcomes of future measurements than quantum theory itself. Our result has significance for the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as applications to tasks that exploit the inherent randomness in quantum theory, such as quantum cryptography.},

abstract = {The predictions that quantum theory makes about the outcomes of measurements
are generally probabilistic. This has raised the question whether quantum
theory can be considered complete, or whether there could exist alternative
theories that provide improved predictions. Here we review recent work that
considers arbitrary alternative theories, constrained only by the requirement
that they are compatible with a notion of "free choice" (defined with respect
to a natural causal order). It is shown that quantum theory is "maximally
informative", i.e., there is no other compatible theory that gives improved
predictions. Furthermore, any alternative maximally informative theory is
necessarily equivalent to quantum theory. This means that the state a system
has in such a theory is in one-to-one correspondence with its
quantum-mechanical state (the wave function). In this sense, quantum theory is
complete.},
