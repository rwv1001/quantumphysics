Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 150402 (2012); arXiv:1208.4123) argued that "no
alternative theory compatible with quantum theory and satisfying the freedom of
choice assumption can give improved predictions". We give a more precise
version of the formulation and proof of this remarkable claim. Our proof
broadly follows theirs, which relies on physically well motivated axioms, but
to fill in some crucial details certain technical assumptions have had to be
added, whose physical status seems somewhat obscure.},

@article{LeegwaterGijs2016Aitf,

abstract = {Recently, Roger Colbeck and Renato Renner (C&R) have claimed that ‘[n]o extension of quantum theory can have improved predictive power’ (Colbeck & Renner, 2011, 2012b). If correct, this is a spectacular impossibility theorem for hidden-variable theories, which is more general than the theorems of Bell (1964) and Leggett (2003). Also, C&R have used their claim in attempt to prove that a system׳s quantum-mechanical wave function is in a one-to-one correspondence with its ‘ontic’ state (Colbeck & Renner, 2012a). C&R׳s claim essentially means that in any hidden-variable theory that is compatible with quantum-mechanical predictions, probabilities of measurement outcomes are independent of these hidden variables. This makes such variables otiose. On closer inspection, however, the generality and validity of the claim can be contested. First, it is based on an assumption called ‘Freedom of Choice’. As the name suggests, this assumption involves the independence of an experimenter׳s choice of measurement settings. But in the way C&R define this assumption, a no-signalling condition is surreptitiously presupposed, making the assumption less innocent than it sounds. When using this definition, any hidden-variable theory violating parameter independence, such as Bohmian Mechanics, is immediately shown to be incompatible with quantum-mechanical predictions. Also, the argument of C&R is hard to follow, and their mathematical derivation contains several gaps, some of which cannot be closed in the way they suggest. We shall show that these gaps can be filled. The issue with the ‘Freedom of Choice’ assumption can be circumvented by explicitly assuming parameter independence. This makes the result less general, but better founded. We then obtain an impossibility theorem for hidden-variable theories satisfying parameter independence only. As stated above, such hidden-variable theories are impossible in the sense that any supplemental variables have no bearing on outcome probabilities, and are therefore trivial. So, while quantum mechanics itself satisfies parameter independence, if a variable is added that changes the outcome probabilities, however slightly, parameter independence must be violated.
•A no-go theorem is presented for parameter independent hidden-variable theories.•Simpler proofs of existing results related to chained Bell inequalities are included.•The work is based on a no-go theorem by Roger Colbeck and Renato Renner.•Shortcomings of Colbeck and Renner׳s work are addressed.•This work aims to be mathematically thorough and contains some new, necessary steps.},

abstract = {According to quantum theory, measurements generate random outcomes, in stark contrast with classical mechanics. This raises the question of whether there could exist an extension of the theory that removes this indeterminism, as suspected by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. Although this has been shown to be impossible, existing results do not imply that the current theory is maximally informative. Here we ask the more general question of whether any improved predictions can be achieved by any extension of quantum theory. Under the assumption that measurements can be chosen freely, we answer this question in the negative: no extension of quantum theory can give more information about the outcomes of future measurements than quantum theory itself. Our result has significance for the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as applications to tasks that exploit the inherent randomness in quantum theory, such as quantum cryptography.},

considers arbitrary alternative theories, constrained only by the requirement
that they are compatible with a notion of "free choice" (defined with respect

informative", i.e., there is no other compatible theory that gives improved
predictions. Furthermore, any alternative maximally informative theory is
necessarily equivalent to quantum theory. This means that the state a system
has in such a theory is in one-to-one correspondence with its
quantum-mechanical state (the wave function). In this sense, quantum theory is
complete.},

abstract = {The Traveling Minds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is a no-collapse interpretation on which the wavefunction evolves deterministically like in the Everett branching multiple-worlds interpretation. As in the Many Minds interpretation, minds navigate the Everett branching structure following the probabilities given by the Born rule. However, in the Traveling Minds interpretation (a variant by Squires and Barrett of the single-mind interpretation), the minds are guaranteed to all travel together—they are always found in the same branch.
The Traveling Forms interpretation extends the Traveling Minds interpretation in an Aristotelian way by having forms of non-minded macroscopic entities that have forms, such as plants, lower animals, bacteria, and planets, travel along the branching structure together with the minds. As a result, while there is deterministic wavefunction-based physics in the branches without minds, non-reducible higher-level structures like life are found only in the branch with minds.
This chapter begins by presenting Humean dispositionalism as an attempt to construct a theory of causal powers without adopting the modal relations between powers and their manifestations that are commonly supposed to be required by contemporary dispositionalists. It argues against the coherence of the compromise in the light of quantum physics: Humean dispositionalism is unable to isolate causal processes in a world with quantum entanglement, and therefore unable to individuate causal powers. John Bell famously demonstrated that the quantum theory diverges from the classical theory in predicting the dependence of the correlations upon the relative angle between the two polarisers—a fact which neither of the particles should be in a position to 'know'. Humean dispositionalism is only half-Humean: Toby Handfield wants to keep an ontology of powers without attributing any of the objectively modal features that characterise Neo-Aristotelian approaches. David Lewis's strict neo-Humean account turns on two principles:Recombination, and (Rec)Humean Supervenience.},

The area of disagreement centers primarily around the problem of describing observations. Formally, the result of a measurement is a superposition of vectors, each representing the quantity being observed as having one of its possible values. The question that has to be answered is how this superposition can be reconciled with the fact that in practice we only observe one value. How is the measuring instrument prodded into making up its mind which value it has observed?},

We find that the decoherence time scales ( approximately 10(-13)-10(-20) s) are typically much shorter than the relevant dynamical time scales ( approximately 10(-3)-10(-1) s), both for regular neuron firing and for kinklike polarization excitations in microtubules. This conclusion disagrees with suggestions by Penrose and others that the brain acts as a quantum computer, and that quantum coherence is related to consciousness in a fundamental way.},

abstract = {The roles of decoherence and environment-induced superselection in the emergence of the classical from the quantum substrate are described. The stability of correlations between the einselected quantum pointer states and the environment allows them to exist almost as objectively as classical states were once thought to exist: there are ways of finding out what is the pointer state of the system which uses redundancy of their correlations with the environment, and which leave einselected states essentially unperturbed. This relatively objective existence of certain quantum states facilitates operational definition of probabilities in the quantum setting. Moreover, once there are states that 'exist'and can be 'found out', a 'collapse' in the traditional sense is no longer necessary--in effect, it has already happened. The records of the observer will contain evidence of an effective collapse. The role of the preferred states in the processing and storage of information is emphasized. The existential interpretation based on the relatively objective existence of stable correlations between the einselected states of observers memory and in the outside universe is formulated and discussed.},
