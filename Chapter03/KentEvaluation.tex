\chapter{Evaluating Kent's Theory\label{KentEval}}
In order to evaluate Kent's theory of quantum physics, it will first be helpful to remind ourselves of the problem we are trying to solve. 

In chapter \ref{BellChapter}, we discussed the EPR-Bohm paradox and the problem of explaining  the mysterious correlations between measurement outcomes of spin singlets in a way consistent with special relativity and the predictions of standard quantum theory. We saw that the Copenhagen interpretation does not seem to be consistent with special relativity. We also discussed Shimony's distinction between Outcome Independence (OI) and Parameter Independence (PI) and Shimony's idea that we should only accept a theory in which OI is false and PI is true. Since PI is false in the pilot-wave theory, we should reject it according to Shimony's criterion. 

But although Shimony's criterion is a promising line of inquiry, by itself, it is not sufficient to resolve the  EPR-Bohm paradox. This is because Shimony's criterion doesn't address the controversial issue of what is meant by an outcome. In chapter \ref{measprobchap}, we discussed this controversy over outcomes and why the many-worlds interpretation that denies the reality of outcomes is unsatisfactory. This motivated the discussion of Kent's theory in chapter \ref{measprobchap} in the hope that it might provide a satisfactory solution to the EPR-Bohm paradox. In the previous chapter, we only got as far as describing the key features of Kent's theory such as it being a one-world theory which posits additional variables to standard quantum theory. 

So having now reminded ourselves of the problem at hand, we see that there are several issues that we need to consider in order to evaluate whether Kent's theory provides a satisfactory solution to this problem. Firstly, we should consider whether the predictions of Kent's theory are consistent with the  predictions of quantum theory that have been experimentally validated. Since standard quantum theory (that is a theory of states whose evolution is determined by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation) predicts the correlations observed in the EPR-Bohm paradox, then if Kent's theory is consistent with standard quantum theory, these EPR-Bohm correlations will also be exhibited in Kent's theory. 

Secondly, since a satisfactory solution to our problem must be consistent with special relativity, we need to consider whether such consistency holds in Kent's theory. Consistency with special relativity is guaranteed in a theory if and only if it is invariant under a group of symmetries called Lorentz transformations. We therefore need to consider whether Kent's theory satisfies Lorentz invariance. 

Thirdly, since a satisfactory theory must be one in which there are outcomes, we need to consider whether Kent succeeds in giving us a convincing account of what an outcome is. In doing this, we will examine how Kent's theory ties in with decoherence theory and d'Espagnat's objection about improper mixtures. 

Butterfield has also emphasized the need to understand Kent's theory in the light of an important theorem proved in recent years, the so-called Collbeck-Renner Theorem\footnote{See \cite{LeegwaterGijs2016Aitf}, \cite{ColbeckRoger2011Neoq}, \cite{ColbeckRoger2012Tcoq}, \cite{LandsmanK2015OtCt}, and \cite{Landsman}.} which says that if a theory satisfies PI together with what is called a `no conspiracy' criterion, then this theory is reducible to standard quantum theory without any hidden variables. On the assumption that a violation of `no conspiracy' would not be acceptable,  this then suggests that any theory that satisfactorily addresses the  EPR-Bohm paradox can't be a hidden-variables theory. We will therefore need to consider whether Kent's model can be an interpretation of quantum physics without it being a hidden-variables theory.

I will argue that in the light all these considerations, Kent's theory does provide a satisfactory solution to the EPR-Bohm paradox. There are still questions concerning the nature of Kent's beables, and Kent's theory may also strike us as rather counter-intuitive given that his theory posits that present events should be conditioned on far-distant future states of affairs. We will therefore conclude this chapter by discussing how Kent's theory could be made to appear less counter-intuitive.

\section{Consistency of Kent's Theory with Standard Quantum Physics\textsuperscript{*}\label{kentinterpretationconsistency}}
\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}
\footnotetext[1]{As mentioned in the introduction on page \pageref{asteriskmeaning}, sections marked with an asterisk may be challenging to readers who do not have a  background in physics.}\label{LorentzInvarianceSection}\renewcommand*{\thefootnote}{\arabic{footnote}}If we are to take Kent's theory seriously, it should be just as good at making predictions as standard quantum theory, and it had better not contradict empirical observations. Over the last century, standard quantum theory has been firmly established scientifically, and so far, it has not been contradicted by any experimental observations. Standard quantum theory allows us to form a quantum state description of a physical system based on how the system was set up in an experimental environment, and then Schr\"{o}dinger's equation can be used to evolve this state forwards in time, and finally, we can calculate expectation values for various physical quantities belonging to this physical system, and these agree with the average values measured on the system when the experiment is performed many times. In other words, standard quantum theory is \textbf{empirically adequate}\index{empirical adequacy!informal definition}\footnote{See p. \pageref{adeq} for a more formal definition of empirical adequacy.} in its domain of applicability. Thus, if we can show that Kent's theory is just as good at making predictions as standard quantum theory, then it too will be empirically adequate to the same degree. This doesn't necessarily mean that Kent's theory will make exactly the same predictions as standard quantum physics, for the additional information that Kent's theory requires beyond standard quantum theory may alter these predictions. Indeed, if this additional information made absolutely no difference to the predictions of standard quantum theory, then it would seem rather redundant. But we should nevertheless be able to derive the predictions of standard quantum theory from Kent's theory by averaging over the unknown variables that describe the additional information in Kent's theory. 

In order to show that Kent's theory is just as good as standard quantum theory, we recall the preliminary calculation of $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ given in section \ref{kentcalculation}:
\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{beable1} revisited}
	\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}=\sum_\tau P(q(\tau) | r(\tau_S,y))\tau=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_\tau\frac{P(q(\tau) \, \& \, r_n)\tau}{P(r_n)}.
\end{equation}
We proceed to calculate $P(r_n)$ and $P(q(\tau)\, \& \,r_n)$ in order to calculate  $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$. We first note that since $S_n$ is a spacelike hypersurface,   there will exist a unitary operator $U_{S_nS_0}$ defined by equation (\ref{SchwingerUnitaryOP}) which maps the Hilbert space\footnote{The Hilbert space $H_S$ for any spacelike hypersurface $S$ is defined on page \pageref{HSdef}.} of states $H_{S_0}$ describing $S_0$ to the Hilbert space of states $H_{S_n}$\label{HSidef} describing $S_n$ in accord with how the states of $H_{S_0}$  evolve over time. Now let $H_{S_n,\tau_S}\label{HStau}\subset H_{S_n}$ be the subspace of states $\ket{\xi}$ for which  $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\xi}=\tau_S(x)\ket{\xi}$  for all $x\in S_n\cap S$, and  let $\{\ket{\xi_1},\ket{\xi_2},\ldots\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$. Given that the initial state of the world is $\ket{\Psi_0}$, the probability $P(r_n)$ of ``measuring'' the value of $T_S(x)$ on $S_n\cap S$ to be $\tau_S(x)$ will be 
\begin{equation}\label{Pri}
P(r_n)=\sum_j \abs{ \ip{\xi_j}{\Psi_n}}^2,
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\Psi_n}=U_{S_nS_0}\ket{\Psi_0}$, and this probability will be independent of the particular orthonormal basis  $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ of $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$.\footnote{To see why this is, we note that we can extend the orthonormal set $\{\ket{\xi_1},\ket{\xi_2},\ldots\}$ to an orthonormal basis  $\{\ket{\xi_1},\ket{\xi_2},\ldots\}\cup\{\ket{\zeta_1},\ket{\zeta_2},\ldots\}$ of $H_{S_n}$ which consists entirely of $\hat{T}_S(x)$-eigenstates for all $x\in S_n\cap S$. We can think of each of the states of this orthonormal basis as the possible measurement outcomes when making the notional measurement of $T_S(x)$ on $S_n\cap S$. By the Born Rule, it therefore follows that $P(r_n)=\sum_j \abs{ \ip{\xi_j}{\Psi_n}}^2$. But to see that this probability is independent of the particular basis, we can uniquely write $\ket{\Psi_n}$ as a sum $\ket{\Psi_n}=\ket{\xi}+\ket{\zeta}$ where $\ket{\xi}$ belongs to the span of $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ and $\ket{\zeta}$ belongs to the span of $\{\ket{\zeta_j}:j\}$.  Then since $\ket{\xi}=\sum_j\ip{\xi_j}{\Psi_n}\ket{\xi_j}$, it follows that $$\ip{\xi}{\xi}=\sum_j\abs{ \ip{\xi_j}{\Psi_n}}^2=P(r_n).$$ Therefore, since  $\ip{\xi}{\xi}$ is independent of the particular basis chosen of $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$, so is $P(r_n)$.  \label{priproof} } If we define 
\begin{equation}\label{tauprojection}
\pi_n=\sum_j\dyad{\xi_j},
\end{equation}
then it is easy to see that
\begin{equation}\label{Prn}
	P(r_n)=\ev*{\pi_n}{\Psi_n}.
\end{equation}
We also see that $\pi_n$ is Hermitian (i.e. has real eigenvalues) and that $\pi_n \pi_n = \pi_n$. Any Hermitian operator $\pi$ with $\pi^2=\pi$ is called a \textbf{projection}\index{projection}. We thus see that $\pi_n$ is a projection.

Turning to the calculation of $P(q(\tau)\, \& \, r_n)$, note that for the Tomonaga-Schwinger formulation of relativistic quantum physics, the operators $\hat{T}_S(x)$ and $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$ for fixed $\mu,\nu$ commute when $x$ and $y$ are spacelike-separated. It therefore follows that we can express any state of $H_{S_n}$ as a superposition of simultaneous eigenstates of $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$ and $\hat{T}_S(x)$ for $x\in S_n\cap S$.\footnote{We make the same approximation as depicted in figure \ref{tauSapprox} on page \pageref{tauSapprox}.}  For a particular choice of $\mu,\nu$, we can then form an orthonormal basis $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$ of $H_{S_n}$ consisting of simultaneous $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$, $\hat{T}_S(x)$-eigenstates so that $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau^{(j)}\ket{\eta_j}$ and $\hat{T}_{S}(x)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau_S^{(j)}(x)\ket{\eta_j}$ for $x\in S_n\cap S$, where $\tau^{(j)}$ and $\tau_S^{(j)}(x)$ are the corresponding eigenvalues. If we define  $\pi_{n,\tau}=\sum_j\dyad{\chi_{j,\tau}}$ where $\{\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}:j\}$ is the subset of $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$ such that $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}=\tau\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}$ and $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}=\tau_S(x)\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}$ for all $x\in S_n\cap S$, then 
\begin{equation}\label{pqtauri}
P(q(\tau)\, \& \,r_n)=\sum_j \abs{ \ip{\chi_{j,\tau}}{\Psi_n}}^2=\ev*{\pi_{n,\tau}}{\Psi_n}.\protect\footnotemark
\end{equation}
\footnotetext{The proof of this is very similar to the proof given in footnote \ref{priproof}.}But if we define $\pi_\tau=\sum_j\dyad{\eta_{j,\tau}}$ where $\{\ket{\eta_{j,\tau}}:j\}$ is the subset of  $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$ with $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)\ket{\eta_{j,\tau}}=\tau\ket{\eta_{j,\tau}}$, then we also have  $\pi_{n,\tau}=\pi_n\pi_\tau$.\footnote{To see why this is, 
we first show that $\pi_n=\sum_j\dyad{h_{n,j}}$ where $\{\ket{h_{n,j}}:j\}$ is the subset of $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$  for which $\ket{h_{n,j}}\in H_{S_n,\tau_S}$. 
Note that $\pi_n\ket{h_{n,j}}=\ket{h_{n,j}}$    since $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ is a basis for $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$ and $\ket{h_{n,j}}\in H_{S_n,\tau_S}$. 
Therefore, $\pi_n\pi_{n,h}=\pi_{n,h}$  where  $\pi_{n,h}=\sum_j\dyad{h_{n,j}}$. 
But  $\pi_{n,h}\ket{\xi_j}=\ket{\xi_j}$ since $\{\ket{h_{n,j}}:j\}$ is a basis for $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$ and $\ket{\xi_j}\in H_{S_n,\tau_S}$. 
Therefore, $\pi_{n,h}\pi_n=\pi_n.$ But $\pi_{n,h}\pi_n= \pi_n\pi_{n,h}$ since $\pi_n$ and $\pi_{n,h}$ are Hermitian. Hence, $\pi_n= \pi_{n,h}$. Now the summands of $\pi_n\pi_\tau$ are only going to consist of those $\dyad{\eta_j}$ for which $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau\ket{\eta_j}$ and for which $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau_S(x)\ket{\eta_j}$ for all $x\in S_n\cap S$, and these are just the $\dyad*{\chi_{j,\tau}}$ which are the summands of  $\pi_{n,\tau}$. Hence,  $\pi_n\pi_\tau=\pi_{n,\tau}.$} 
  Hence,
\begin{equation}\label{pqtauri2}
P(q(\tau)\, \& \, r_n)=\ev*{\pi_n\pi_\tau}{\Psi_n}.
\end{equation}
But clearly $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)=\sum_\tau \tau \pi_\tau.$ Therefore, combining (\ref{beable1}), (\ref{Prn}), and (\ref{pqtauri2}), we have 
\begin{equation}\label{kentconsistency0}
\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\sum_\tau \ev*{\pi_n\pi_\tau}{\Psi_n}\tau}{\ev*{\pi_n}{\Psi_n}}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\ev*{\pi_n\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_n}}{\ev*{\pi_n}{\Psi_n}}.
\end{equation}
We are now in a position to show that Kent's theory is consistent with standard quantum theory. First let us consider what we need to show. 

In the pilot wave interpretation, its consistency with standard quantum theory requires that if one averages the expectation values of an observable over the hidden variables (i.e. the positions and the momenta of all the particles) then one obtains the expectation value of the observable given by standard quantum theory as indicated in equation (\ref{bohmconsistency}). 

Now in Kent's theory, the hidden variables on which his beables $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ depend are the values $\tau_S(x)$ of $T_S(x)$ for $x\in S^1(y)\cap S$. The operator $\pi_n$ in equation (\ref{kentconsistency0}) in the limit as $n\rightarrow\infty$ encapsulates this hidden information. To remind ourselves of $\pi_n$'s dependency on $\tau_S$ restricted to $S_n\cap S$, we will now write $\pi_n(\tau_{S_n\cap S})$ for $\pi_n$ where $\tau_{S_n\cap S}$ is the function $\tau_S$ restricted to $S_n\cap S$. Likewise, we will write  $r_n(\tau_{S_n\cap S})$ for $r_n$, the statement that $T_S(x)=\tau_S(x)$ for all $x\in S_n(y)\cap S$. If we let $j$ index all possible functions $\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}$ taking real values on $S_n\cap S$,\footnote{Recall that we are implicitly using an approximation scheme described by equation (\ref{tauapproxformula}), so we are really considering functions on the cells of a mesh over $S_n\cap S $ taking values from a finite pool of possible values. Also see footnote \ref{snapprox}. This is why we can use an index $j$ to index all the $\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}.$ } then the analogue of (\ref{bohmconsistency}) requires us to show that 
\begin{equation}\label{kentconsistency}
\ev*{\hat{\bm{T}}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_0}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j}P\big(r_n(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})\big)\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}}
\end{equation}
for all $y$ lying between $S_0$ and $S$, where the left-hand side of (\ref{kentconsistency}) is just the expectation value of $\hat{\bm{T}}^{\mu\nu}(y)$ in the Heisenberg picture as predicted by standard quantum theory.\footnote{Where we are using Schwinger's bold typeface convention as described in footnote \ref{boldref}.} Equation (\ref{kentconsistency}) is sufficient to establish consistency with standard quantum theory because ultimately, all observables are going to be reducible to expressions dependent on $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$, since once we know what to expect for $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$, we will know what to expect for the energy and momentum densities for all measuring apparatus readouts etc. and hence what to expect for all measurement outcomes. But from (\ref{Prn}) and (\ref{kentconsistency0}), we have 
\begin{equation}\label{kentconsistency1}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_jP\big(r_n(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})\big)\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j}{\ev*{\pi_{n}(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_n}}
\end{equation}
Since there is an orthonormal basis $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$ of $H_{S_n}$ consisting of simultaneous $\hat{T}_S(x)$-eigenstates so that $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}(x)\ket{\eta_j}$ for all $x\in S_n\cap S$, it follows that $\sum_j \pi_{n}(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})=I$. Combining this with (\ref{kentconsistency1}) we get
\begin{equation}\label{kentconsistency2}
	\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_jP\big(r_n(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})\big)\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_n}
	\end{equation}
In the notation of equation (\ref{schwingerformula}), we have $\ket*{\Psi_n}=\ket*{\Psi[S_n]}$, and according to (\ref{schwingerformula}) the expectation value $\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi[S_n]}$ will be independent of the hypersurface $S_n$ so long as it contains $y$, and the result will be equal to the expectation value $\ev*{\hat{\bm{T}}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_0}$ in the Heisenberg picture which is the value that is predicted by standard quantum mechanics. Therefore, equation (\ref{kentconsistency}) follows from (\ref{schwingerformula}) and (\ref{kentconsistency2}) which is what we were aiming to show for standard quantum consistency to hold.



\section{Kent's Theory and Lorentz Invariance\label{LorentzInvariance}\textsuperscript{*}}
In order to explain what it means for Kent's theory to be Lorentz invariant, we first need to explain how spacetime coordinates look to different observers. 

Up until now we have been representing a spacetime location by a four-tuple $(x^0,$ $x^1,$ $x^2,$ $x^3)$ where $(x^i)_{i=1}^3$ are spatial coordinates, and where $x^0=ct$ with $c$ being equal to the speed of light and $t$ being the time. It will be convenient to represent spacetime locations using a more concise notation. So we let $(1,0,0,0)$ correspond to the spacetime location $\hat{e}_0$, $(0,1,0,0)$ correspond to the spacetime location $\hat{e}_1$, etc.. Then we can express any other spacetime location  as a sum $\sum_{\mu=0}^3x^\mu\hat{e}_\mu$. We will use the so-called \textbf{Einstein summation convention}\index{Einstein summation convention}\label{Einsteinsum} of dropping the summation sign and implicitly assuming that there is a summation whenever an upper index and a lower index are the same so that we can write $x^\mu\hat{e}_\mu$ instead of $\sum_{\mu=0}^3x^\mu\hat{e}_\mu$. We also use the convention of letting Greek letters range over $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ (e.g. the $\mu$ in $x^\mu\hat{e}_\mu$), and of letting Roman letters range over $1$, $2$, and $3$ (e.g. the $i$ in $(x^i)_{i=1}^3$).

Now suppose an observer $O$ expresses spacetime locations in terms of $\{\hat{e}_\mu:\mu=0,\ldots,3\}$ and hence uses the coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$ to describe various spacetime locations. For another observer $O'$, it may be more natural to express spacetime locations in terms of a different set $\{\hat{e}'_\mu:\mu=0,\ldots,3\}$ so that the location described by $O$ as $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$ would be described by $O'$ as $({x'}^0, {x'}^1, {x'}^2, {x'}^3)$ where ${x'}^\mu{\hat{e}'}_\mu=x^\mu\hat{e}_\mu$.  For instance if $O$ and $O'$ are moving with respect to each other, they may both want to use coordinates in which their own spatial coordinates are fixed and in which the spatial coordinates of the other observer are changing. As another example, figure \ref{rotfigure} shows how the $(x^1, x^2)$-coordinates transform under a spatial rotation.

\end{figure}

Now the key fact about all observers is that they must always observe light in a vacuum to have a constant speed $c$. Thus,  for a photon that goes through the spacetime locations $(0,0,0,0)$ and $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$ in the coordinates of $O$, we must have $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)=(ct,tv^1,tv^2,tv^3)$ where 
$$\sqrt{(v^1)^2 +(v^2)^2+(v^3)^2}=c.$$ But if $(0,0,0,0)$ and $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$ corresponds to $(0,0,0,0)$ and $({x'}^0, {x'}^1, {x'}^2, {x'}^3)$ respectively in the coordinates of another observer $O'$, then we must also have $({x'}^0, {x'}^1, {x'}^2, {x'}^3)=(ct',t'{v'}^1,t'{v'}^2,t'{v'}^3)$ where 
$$\sqrt{({v'}^1)^2 +({v'}^2)^2+({v'}^3)^2}=c.$$ 
In either case, we must have 
\begin{equation}\label{invariant}
(x^0)^2- (x^1)^2- (x^2)^2 - (x^3)^2=({x'}^0)^2- ({x'}^1)^2- ({x'}^2)^2 - ({x'}^3)^2=0.
\end{equation}
If we define $\eta_{00}=1$, $\eta_{ii}=-1$ for $i=1,2,3$ and $\eta_{\mu\nu}=0$ for $\mu\neq\nu$, then using the Einstein summation convention as well as the convention of lowering indices so that we define $x_\mu\myeq\eta_{\mu\nu}x^\nu$, then (\ref{invariant}) is equivalent to 
$$x_\mu x^\mu={x'}_\mu {x'}^\mu=0.$$ 
Thus, for any coordinate transformation $x\rightarrow x'$ such that  $x_\mu x^\mu={x'}_\mu{x'}^\mu$,  if the speed of light is $c$ in the $x$-coordinates, then the speed of light is also guaranteed to be $c$ in the $x'$-coordinates.  A \textbf{Lorentz transformation}\index{Lorentz transformation} $\Lambda$ is any coordinate transformation of the form ${x'}^\mu=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}x^\nu$\label{coordtansformation} such that $x_\mu x^\mu={x'}_\mu{x'}^\mu$. Since a Lorentz transformation must satisfy
$$x_\mu x^\mu=\eta_{\mu\rho}\Lambda\indices{^\rho_\sigma}x^\sigma\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}x^\nu$$
for all $x$, it follows that  
\begin{equation}\label{lorentztrans}
\Lambda\indices{^\rho_\mu}\eta_{\rho\sigma}\Lambda\indices{^\sigma_\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}.\protect\footnotemark
\end{equation}
\footnotetext{To see why this is, note that if  $x_\mu x^\mu={x'}_\mu{x'}^\mu$ for all $x$, then  for any other spacetime location $y$, we have $(x+y)_\mu (x+y)^\mu={(x'+y')}_\mu{(x'+y')}^\mu$. If we expand this out and cancel $x_\mu x^\mu$ with ${x'}_\mu{x'}^\mu$ and cancel $y_\mu y^\mu$ with ${y'}_\mu{y'}^\mu$, and using the fact that $y_\mu x^\mu=x_\mu y^\mu$, etc. we find that  $x_\mu y^\mu={x'}_\mu{y'}^\mu$ for all $x$ and $y$. Hence,
$$\eta_{\nu\mu}x^\mu y^\nu = x_\mu y^\mu=\eta_{\sigma\rho}\Lambda\indices{^\rho_\mu}\Lambda\indices{^\sigma_\nu}x^\mu y^\nu.$$  
Since we can choose $x$ such that $x^\mu=1$ and $x^\alpha = 0$ for $\alpha\neq\mu$, and can choose $y$ such that $y^\nu=1$ and $y^\beta=0$ for $\beta\neq\nu$. Then we get
$$\eta_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\sigma\rho}\Lambda\indices{^\rho_\mu}\Lambda\indices{^\sigma_\nu}, $$ and hence the result follows.}Having considered how the coordinates of a spacetime location viewed by one observer relate to the coordinates of the same spacetime location viewed by a different observer, we can now consider how physical quantities viewed by different observers relate to each other. The simplest kind of physical quantity is called a \textbf{scalar}\index{scalar}. A scalar defined at a particular spacetime location has the same value no matter what frame of reference an observer uses. One example of a scalar is an object's \textbf{rest mass}\index{rest mass} which is the mass an object would have if it had no velocity. There is still a transformation rule for scalars since the spacetime location at which the scalar is measured is usually expressed in terms of an observer's coordinate system, and the coordinates of  such a location  will differ for different observers. Thus, if $\phi(x)\myeq\phi(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$ is the value of a scalar defined at the spacetime location $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$ as described by an observer $O$, then another observer $O'$ using a different set of coordinate $({x'}^0, {x'}^1, {x'}^2, {x'}^3)$ to describe the spacetime location $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$ will describe this same scalar as $\phi'(x')\myeq\phi'({x'}^0, {x'}^1, {x'}^2, {x'}^3)$  where $\phi'(x')=\phi(x)$. Therefore
\begin{equation}\label{lorentzscalar}
\phi'(x')=\phi(\Lambda^{-1}x')
\end{equation} 
where $\Lambda^{-1}$ is the inverse Lorentz transformation that takes the coordinates $x'=({x'}^0, {x'}^1, {x'}^2, {x'}^3)$ of a spacetime location to the coordinates $x=(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$ describing that spacetime location. Thus, equation (\ref{lorentzscalar}) shows us how a scalar transforms under a Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$. 

Many physical quantities, however, are not scalars and so will look different to different observers. For instance, the energy of an object has a kinetic component that depends on the velocity the object has relative to an observer. However, it turns out that if an observer $O$ considers an object's energy $E$ together with its three components of momentum $p^1, p^2$, and $p^3$ (in the directions $\hat{e}_1$, $\hat{e}_2$, and $\hat{e}_3$ respectively) to form the four-tuple $p\myeq(E/c, p^1, p^2, p^3)$ known as the object's \textbf{four-momentum}\index{four-momentum}, then $p$ transforms in the same way as spacetime coordinates transform between different observers. In other words, a different observer $O'$ whose coordinates are given by ${x'}^\mu=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}x^\nu$ would observe the object's four-momentum to be ${p'}^\mu=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}p^\nu$.\footnote{In order for $p$ to transform in this way, we have to redefine what we mean by energy and momentum. In classical mechanics, the momentum of an object is the product of the object's mass and its velocity. In the context of special relativity, however, the four-momentum of an object is defined to be the product of its rest mass $m_0$ and its \textbf{four-velocity}\index{four-velocity} where the four velocity of an object is a four-tuple $(u^0, u^1, u^2, u^3)$ with $u_\mu u^\mu=c^2$ such that the object's velocity (in the classical sense) is the vector $(c \frac{u^1}{u^0}, c \frac{u^2}{u^0}, c\frac{u^3}{u^0})$. The motivation for this definition can be seen by considering an object whose classical velocity is $\vb{v}=(v^1,v^2,v^3)$ that goes through $(0,0,0,0)$. It will have a spacetime trajectory $x(t)=(ct, v^1 t, v^2 t, v^3 t)$. $u$ is just the four-vector proportional to $x(1)$ with $u_\mu u^\mu=c^2$, so if $\gamma$ is the constant of proportionality such that $u^0=\gamma c$ and $u^i=\gamma v^i$, then by eliminating $\gamma$ we get $v^i=c\frac{u^i}{u^0}$.  We can then easily work out the constant of proportionality $\gamma$ and hence the
four-velocity $u$ of an object whose classical velocity is $\vb{v}$. For we must have $u^i=\frac{v^i u^0}{c}$, for $i=1$ to $3$. Therefore, since $u_\mu u^\mu=c^2$, we must have $(u^0)^2\big(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\big)=c^2$ where $v=\sqrt{({v}^1)^2+({v}^2)^2+({v}^3)^2}$. Thus, if we define $\beta={v}/{c}$ and $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$, then $u^0=\gamma c$ and $u^i=\gamma v^i$ for $i=1$ to $3$, and hence the four-velocity of the object must be $u=\gamma(c,v^1,v^2,v^3).$ From this, we see that the object's four-momentum will be $\gamma m_0(c,v^1,v^2,v^3).$ If the object's velocity is very small compared to the speed of light, then $\gamma\approx 1+\frac{v^2}{2c^2}$, and hence the object's four-momentum $(E/c, p^1, p^2, p^3)$ will be approximately $(m_0c+\frac{1}{2}m_0{v^2}/c, m_0v^1,m_0v^2,m_0v^3)$. Therefore, $(p^1, p^2, p^3)$ is approximately equal to the classical momentum. However, the energy is now $E=m_0c^2+\frac{1}{2}m_0{v^2}$. Thus, in addition to the kinetic energy term $\frac{1}{2}m_0{v^2}$, there is a rest mass energy $m_0c^2$. If we define the \textbf{relativistic mass}\index{relativistic mass} $m=\gamma m_0$, then we obtain Einstein's famous formula $E=mc^2$.  } More generally, any list of four physical quantities $(\varphi^0, \varphi^1, \varphi^2, \varphi^3)$ that transforms as $\varphi\rightarrow\varphi'$ with  ${\varphi'}^\mu=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}\varphi^\nu$ is called a \textbf{four-vector}\index{four-vector}.

	\caption{Shows how a four-vector ${\varphi}$ (of which only two components are shown) defined at a spacetime location (indicated by $\bullet$) can be expressed either as $(\varphi^1, \varphi^2)$ with respect to the basis $\{\hat{e}_1,\hat{e}_2\}$ or as $({\varphi'}^1,{\varphi'}^2)$ with respect to the basis $\{\hat{e}'_1,\hat{e}'_2\}$.}\label{rotfigure2}
	\end{figure}
	Figure \ref{rotfigure2} shows how (two of) the components of a four-vector $\varphi$ at a particular location will differ for different observers under a spatial rotation of the coordinates. A four-vector $\varphi^\mu(x)$ defined at every spacetime location $x$ is called a \textbf{four-vector field}\index{four-vector field}. Thus,  at each spacetime location $x$, the four-vector field $\varphi^\mu(x)$ assigns four numbers, $\varphi^0(x)$, $\varphi^1(x)$, $\varphi^2(x)$, and $\varphi^3(x)$. If $O$ observes this vector-field $\varphi^\mu(x)$, and $O'$ is another observer whose coordinates are related to the coordinates $O$ via the Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$, then $O'$ will describe the same physical reality that $O$ describes by assigning four numbers ${\varphi'}^0(x')$, ${\varphi'}^1(x')$, ${\varphi'}^2(x')$, and ${\varphi'}^3(x')$ at every spacetime location $x'$, and the relationship between the description $O$ gives and the  description $O'$ gives will be given by the formula
	$${\varphi'}^\mu(x')=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}\varphi^\nu(x).$$
	Hence, under the Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$,  a vector field $\varphi^\mu(x)$ transforms as ${\varphi}^\mu(x)\rightarrow {\varphi'}^\mu(x')$ where
	\begin{equation}\label{lorentzvector}
	{\varphi'}^\mu(x')=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}\varphi^\nu(\Lambda^{-1}x').
	\end{equation} 



From a four-vector $\varphi^\mu$, we can also define the so-called \textbf{four-covector}\index{four-covector}: 
\begin{equation}\label{covector}
	\varphi_\mu\myeq\eta_{\mu\nu}\varphi^\nu.
\end{equation}
To see how four-covectors transform under a Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$, it will be helpful to define 
\begin{equation}\label{colambda}
	\Lambda\indices{_\mu^\nu}\myeq\eta_{\mu\rho}\eta^{\nu\sigma}\Lambda\indices{^\rho_\sigma}
\end{equation}
where $\eta^{\nu\sigma}=\eta_{\nu\sigma}$. If we also define the \textbf{Kronecker-delta}\index{Kronecker-delta} $\delta^\nu_\mu$ such that $\delta^\nu_\mu=1$ when $\mu=\nu$ and $\delta^\nu_\mu=0$ otherwise, then using the fact that $\eta_{\mu\rho}\eta^{\nu\rho}=\delta^\nu_\mu$ together with equation (\ref{lorentztrans}), we have 
\begin{equation}\label{lambdainverse}
\Lambda\indices{^\rho_\mu}\Lambda\indices{_\rho^\nu}=\delta^\nu_\mu.
\end{equation}
Since by definition, the inverse of $\Lambda^{-1}$ satisfies 
$(\Lambda^{-1})\indices{^\nu_\rho}\Lambda\indices{^\rho_\mu}=\delta^\nu_\mu,$
 we have $(\Lambda^{-1})\indices{^\nu_\rho}=\Lambda\indices{_\rho^\nu}.$  From (\ref{lorentzvector}), (\ref{covector}), and (\ref{colambda}), we therefore see that under a Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$, a four-covector field $\varphi_\mu(x)$ transforms as $\varphi_\mu(x)\rightarrow\varphi'_\mu(x')$
where
\begin{equation}\label{lorentzcovector}
\varphi'_\mu(x')=\Lambda\indices{_\mu^\nu}\varphi_\nu(\Lambda^{-1}x')
\end{equation}
 

Besides scalars, four-vectors, and four-covectors, we also need to consider physical quantities called rank-two tensors. The stress-energy tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$ introduced on page \pageref{stressenergy} is an example of a rank-two tensor. The defining property of a rank-two tensor field $\varphi^{\mu\nu}(x)$ is that under a Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$, it transforms as $\varphi^{\mu\nu}(x)\rightarrow{\varphi'}^{\mu\nu}(x')$ where
\begin{equation}\label{lorentztensor}
{\varphi'}^{\mu\nu}(x')=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\rho}\Lambda\indices{^\nu_\sigma}\varphi^{\rho\sigma}(\Lambda^{-1}x').
\end{equation}
On page \pageref{massenergydensity}, we introduced the mass-energy density $T_S(x)$ on a spacelike hypersurface $S$. As explained in section \ref{massenergydensity}, the values of $T_S(x)$ for all $x\in S$ are the additional values that Kent uses to supplement standard quantum theory.  It was mentioned in passing that $T_S(x)$ does not depend on which frame of reference one is in. In other words, $T_S(x)$ is a scalar. I will now explain why this is so. 

We first need to consider the precise definition of $T_S(x)$. At each spacetime location on the spacelike hypersurface $S$ which an observer $O$ describes as having coordinates $x=(x^\mu)_{\mu=0}^3$, we define  $\eta^\mu(x)$ to be the future-directed  unit four-vector at $x$ that is orthogonal to $S$. In other words, $\eta^0(x)>0$, $\eta_\mu(x)\eta^\mu(x)=1$, and if $y\in S$ is very close to $x$, then 
\begin{equation}\label{etaorthog}
\frac{(x-y)_\mu\eta^\mu(x)}{\sqrt{(x-y)_\nu(x-y)^\nu}}\approx 0.
\end{equation}$T_S(x)$ is then given by the formula 
\begin{equation}\label{TSdef}
T_S(x)=T^{\mu\nu}(x)\eta_{\mu}(x)\eta_{\nu}(x).
\end{equation}
For example, if $S$ was the spacelike hypersurface consisting of all spacetime locations $x = (0,x^1,x^2,x^3)$, then $\big(\eta^{0}(x),\eta^{1}(x),\eta^{3}(x),\eta^{3}(x)\big) =(1,0,0,0),$ and hence $T_S(x)=T^{00}(x)$ which is the density of relativistic mass at $x$, i.e. the energy density at $x$ divided by $c^2$. Note that the condition that $y\in S$ is very close to $x$ in (\ref{etaorthog}) means that $T_S(x)$ only has a local dependence \label{localdependenceS} on $S$ in the vicinity of $x$. i.e. if $S'$ only differs from $S$ outside the vicinity of $x$, then  $T_{S'}(x)=T_S(x).$

To see why $T_S(x)$ is a scalar, suppose that $\Lambda$ is a Lorentz transformation such that $\Lambda\indices{^0_\mu}\eta^\mu>0$ for any future-directed  unit four-vector vector $\eta^\mu$. We refer to a $\Lambda$ with this property as an \textbf{orthochronous}\index{Lorentz transformation!orthochronous} Lorentz transformation. Also, suppose that $O$ and $O'$ are two observers such that spacetime locations that observer $O$ describes as having coordinates $x=(x^\mu)_{\mu=0}^3$ are described by $O'$ as having coordinates $x'=(\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}x^\nu)_{\mu=0}^3$. Then since ${x'}_\mu{y'}^\mu= x_\mu y^\mu$, it follows that the future-directed unit four-vector orthogonal to $S$ at $x$ which $O$ describes as $\eta^\mu(x)$ will be described by $O'$ as  ${\eta'}^\mu(x')=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}\eta^\nu(x)$. Thus, for any spacetime location in $S$ that $O'$ describes as having coordinates $x'$ with corresponding  future-directed $S$-orthogonal unit four-vector ${\eta'}^\mu(x')$, $O'$ can construct a function $T'_S(x')$  with 
\begin{equation}\label{TSprimedef}
T'_S(x')=T'^{\mu\nu}(x')\eta'_{\mu}(x')\eta'_{\nu}(x').
\end{equation}
Then using  (\ref{lorentzcovector}) and (\ref{lorentztensor}) on the right-hand side of (\ref{TSprimedef}),  we have
\begin{equation}\label{invariantTS1}
\begin{split}
T'_S(x')&=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\rho}\Lambda\indices{^\nu_\sigma}T^{\rho\sigma}(x)\Lambda\indices{_\mu^\alpha}\eta_{\alpha}(x)\Lambda\indices{_\nu^\beta}\eta_{\beta}(x)\\
&=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\rho}\Lambda\indices{_\mu^\alpha} \Lambda\indices{^\nu_\sigma}\Lambda\indices{_\nu^\beta}T^{\rho\sigma}(x)\eta_{\alpha}(x)\eta_{\beta}(x)\\
&=\delta^\alpha_\rho\delta^\beta_\sigma T^{\rho\sigma}(x)\eta_{\alpha}(x)\eta_{\beta}(x)\\
&=T^{\alpha\beta}(x)\eta_{\alpha}(x)\eta_{\beta}(x)\\
&=T_S(x)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where on the third line we have used (\ref{lambdainverse}), and on the last line we have used (\ref{TSdef}). To obtain (\ref{invariantTS1}), we assumed that $\Lambda$ is orthochronous because definition (\ref{TSdef}) assumes that $\eta^\mu(x)$ is future-directed. But if $\Lambda$ is non-orthochronous, we would need to take the negations of ${\eta'}^\mu(x')$ to get the future-directed $S$-orthogonal unit four-vector. But clearly this will not affect the equality in (\ref{invariantTS1}), so (\ref{invariantTS1}) holds for all Lorentz transformations, whether they are orthochronous or non-orthochronous.  We thus see that   $T_S(x)$ is a scalar.

Let us now consider the Hilbert space $H_{S_n}$  for a spacelike hypersurface $S_n$ as defined on page \pageref{HSidef}.\footnote{Also see page \pageref{HSdef} for the definition of $H_S$.} 
Given that $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ is the observable in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture whose eigenstates with eigenvalues $\tau$ are the states of $S_n$ for which an observer $O$ observes the stress-energy tensor $T^{\mu\nu}(x)$ to take the value $\tau$ at $x$, it follows from (\ref{TSdef}) that 
\begin{equation}\label{TShat}
	\hat{T}_S(x)\myeq \hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)\eta_{\mu}(x)\eta_{\nu}(x)
	\end{equation}
will be the observable whose eigenstates with eigenvalues $\tau_S(x)$ are the states of $S_n$ for which an observer $O$ observes $T_S(x)$ to take the value $\tau_S(x)$ at $x$ when $x\in S_n\cap S$.\footnote{So long as $S_n$ and $S$ are tangential at $x$ as noted in footnote \ref{tangentialnote}.}
 
Now two observers $O$ and $O'$ will typically assign different physical states to $S_n$ based on their frame of reference. E.g. if $O$ and $O'$ are traveling at different speeds, they will attribute different energy levels and momenta to the spacetime locations of $S_n$. To understand the relationship between the states $O$ assigns to $S_n$ and the states $O'$ assigns, suppose $\ket*{\psi}$ and  $\ket*{\chi}$ are two states that an observer $O$ might judge $S_n$ to be in. As usual, we suppose the coordinates $x^\mu$ of observer $O$ transform to coordinates ${x'}^\mu=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}x^\nu$ of observer $O'$ for some Lorentz transformation $\Lambda.$ We also suppose that the states $\ket*{\psi}$ and $\ket*{\chi}$ that $O$ observes will transform to states $\ket*{\psi'}$  and $\ket*{\chi'}$ that $O'$ observes. We will denote the Hilbert space of the states on $S_n$ that $O'$ can observe as $H_{S_n}'$.\label{Hprimespace}\footnote{As we will discuss shortly, there is a map inner product preserving map $U(\Lambda)$ via which there is a one-to-one correspondence between states in $H_{S_n}$ and states in $H_{S_n}'$ so we can identify $H_{S_n}'$ with $H_{S_n}$ in which case $U(\Lambda)$ will be a unitary operator.}

Now if  $O$ judged $S_n$ to be in the superposition state $\ket{\psi}+\ket{\chi}$, then $O'$ would judge $S_n$ to be proportional to the superposition state $\ket{\psi'}+\ket{\chi'}$. Also recall that $\ket*{\psi'}$ and $\lambda\ket*{\psi'}$ represent the same physical state for any complex number $\lambda$, so there is sufficient flexibility as to which state we deem $\ket*{\psi}$ transforms to that we can deem the transformation $\ket{\psi}\rightarrow\ket*{\psi'}$ to be a linear transformation. But also note that if observer $O$ uses the Born rule to calculate the transition probability from state $\ket*{\psi}$ to state $\ket*{\chi}$, and  observer $O'$ uses the Born rule to calculate the transition probability from state $\ket*{\psi'}$ to state $\ket*{\chi'}$, then they should calculate the same probabilities. We must therefore have
$$|\ip*{\chi}{\psi}|^2=|\ip*{\chi'}{\psi'}|^2.$$
Using this fact together with the fact that $\ket*{\psi}$ and $\lambda\ket*{\psi}$ represent the same physical states, it can be shown that there is a unitary operator $U(\Lambda)$ which relates the states $\ket*{\psi}$ and $\ket*{\psi'}$ via the formulated
$$\ket*{\psi'}=U(\Lambda)\ket*{\psi}.\protect\footnotemark$$\footnotetext{For more details, see \cite{Wigner1939}. Since a unitary operator maps a Hilbert space to itself, we first need to identify $H_{S_n}$ and $H_{S_n}'$ in order for $U(\Lambda)$ to be unitary.}At this point, it is worth clarifying the different meanings of $T^{\mu\nu}(x)$, $T^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$, $\tau^{\mu\nu}(x)$, $\tau^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$,  $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ and $\hat{T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item We use $T^{\mu\nu}(x)$ to refer to the description of the physical quantity that is being observed by $O$. Thus, $T^{\mu\nu}(x)$ is shorthand for the description ``the $\mu\nu$-component of the stress-energy tensor that $O$ observes at the spacetime location belonging to $S$ that $O$ describes as  $x$.'' 
\item Similarly,  $T^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$ is shorthand for the description ``the $\mu\nu$-component of the stress-energy tensor that $O'$ observes at a spacetime location  belonging to $S$ that $O'$ describes as $x'$.'' 
\item $\tau^{\mu\nu}(x)$ stands for a particular (real) value of the physical quantity described by $T^{\mu\nu}(x)$ that $O$ observes, and 
\item $\tau^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$ stands for a particular (real) value of the physical quantity described by $T^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$ that $O'$ observes.
\item $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ for $x\in S_n$ is the Tomonaga-Schwinger observable acting on $H_{S_n}$ such that if observer $O$ deemed $S_n$ to be in an eigenstate $\ket*{\psi}$ of $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ with eigenvalue $\tau$ (a real number), then observer $O$ would observe the physical quantity described by  $T^{\mu\nu}(x)$ to have the value $\tau$.\footnote{Note that we consider a real number $\tau$ here rather than a real valued function $\tau^{\mu\nu}(x)$ of spacetime locations $x\in S$ and indices $\mu$ and $\nu$ since $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ will not in general commute for different values of $\mu$, $\nu$, so we won't be able to find a state which is a simultaneous eigenstate for all the different observables $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$, though we may find a state which is very close to being an eigenstate of all the  $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ for different $\mu$ and $\nu$.} 
\item $\hat{T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$ is the Tomonaga-Schwinger observable acting on $H_{S_n}'$ such that if observer $O'$ deemed $S_n$ to be in an eigenstate $\ket*{\psi'}$ of  $\hat{T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$ with eigenvalue $\tau'$, then observer $O'$ would observe the physical quantity described by  $T^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')$ to have the value $\tau'$. 
\item $T_S(x)={T}^{\mu\nu}(x)\eta_{\mu}(x)\eta_{\nu}(x)$ is shorthand for the description ``the mass-energy density of the spacelike hypersurface $S$ observed by observer $O$ at a spacetime location that $O$ describes as $x$''. 
\item $T'_S(x')={T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')\eta'_{\mu}(x')\eta'_{\nu}(x')$ is shorthand for the description ``the mass-energy density of the spacelike hypersurface $S$ observed by observer $O'$ at a spacetime location that $O'$ describes as $x'$''. 
\item The function $\tau_S(x)$ stands for a particular range of values for each $x\in S$ of the physical quantity described by $T_S(x)$ observed by $O$. 
\item The function $\tau'_S(x')$ stands for a particular range of values for each $x'\in S$ of the physical quantity described by $T'_S(x')$ observed by $O'$. 
\item For each $x\in S$, $\hat{T}_S(x)=\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)\eta_{\mu}(x)\eta_{\nu}(x)$ is the Tomonaga-Schwinger observable  such that if an observer $O$ deems $S$ to be in an eigenstate $\ket*{\psi}\in H_{S_n}$ of  $\hat{T}_S(x)$ with eigenvalue $\tau$ (a real number), then  $O$ would observe the physical quantity described by  $T_S(x)$ to have the value $\tau$. 
\item For each $x'\in S$, $\hat{T}'_S(x')=\hat{T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(x)\eta'_{\mu}(x')\eta'_{\nu}(x')$ is the Tomonaga-Schwinger observable  such that if an observer $O'$ deems $S$ to be in an eigenstate $\ket*{\psi'}\in H'_{S_n}$ of  $\hat{T}'_S(x')$ with eigenvalue $\tau'$ (a real number), then  $O'$ would observe the physical quantity described by  $T'_S(x')$ to have the value $\tau'$. 
\end{itemize}



Having clarified this terminology, we see that if $\ket*{\psi}\in H_{S_n}$ is a state for which $T^{\mu\nu}(x)\approx \tau^{\mu\nu}(x)$,\footnote{We say approximately ($\approx$) here since the operators $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}$ will not in general commute, so we won't typically be able to find a state $\ket*{\psi}$ which is an eigenstate for all the observables $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}$. It is the non-commutativity of observables that is responsible for Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.} and if $\ket*{\psi'}\in H_{S_n}'$ is a state for which $T^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')\approx \tau^{\mu\nu}(x')$, then
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(x)\ket{\psi}&\approx\tau^{\mu\nu}(x)\ket{\psi}, \text{ and }\label{stres1}\\ 
\hat{T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')\ket{\psi'}&\approx{\tau'}^{\mu\nu}(x')\ket{\psi'}.\label{stres1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
It then follows from (\ref{stres1}) that if $\ket{\psi'}=U(\Lambda)\ket{\psi}$, then
\begin{equation}\label{stress3}
    U(\Lambda)^{-1}\hat{T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')U(\Lambda)\ket{\psi}\approx{T'}^{\mu\nu}(x')\ket{\psi}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, in order for (\ref{lorentztensor}) to hold for ${T'}^{\mu\nu}(x')$ in the classical limit (where we treat the stress-energy observables as though they commute with each other and replace the approximations by equalities), by plugging an operator form of  (\ref{lorentztensor}) into (\ref{stress3}), we see that we must have
\begin{equation}\label{TUrelation}

\end{equation}



Now to say that Kent's model is Lorentz invariant, is to say that (\ref{kentconsistency0}) defines a rank-two tensor, for then this quantity and the quantities on which it depends will transform in the way that physical quantities should transform under a Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ when the spacetime coordinates of two observers $O$ and $O'$ are related by the formula ${x'}^\mu=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\nu}x^\nu$.\footnote{Note that having a privileged spacelike hypersurface $S$ in which a notional measurement of $T_S$ is made does not of itself break Lorentz invariance. Just because we are privileging a spacelike hypersurface $S$, we are not making any assumptions about simultaneity being defined by $S$. Because spacelike separation is a Lorentz invariant proper, both $O$ and $O'$ will deem the spacetime locations on $S$ to be spacelike separated. The Lorentz transformation itself has absolutely no effect on what $S$ is. It is just that $O$ and $O'$ will use different coordinates to describe a particular spacetime location on $S$. It maybe that in the coordinate system of $O$, some of the spacetime locations of $S$ are simultaneous (i.e. have the same $x^0$ value), but there is no requirement of simultaneity, and there is no claim that a reference frame in which the spacetime locations of $S$ are simultaneous is particularly special. In Kent's theory, it is sufficient for there to be just one hypersurface on which  $T_S$ has a determinate value. But if another hypersurface were to be chosen instead, it would make no difference to empirical adequacy since (\ref{kentconsistency}) will hold regardless of what spacelike hypersurface $S$ is chosen.} Thus, in order to show that Kent's model is Lorentz invariant, we need to show that if $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ is an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space of states\footnote{Thus, $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$ is the subspace of states $\ket{\xi}\in H_{S_n}$ for which  $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\xi}=\tau_S(x)\ket{\xi}$  for all $x\in S_n\cap S$ as mentioned on page \pageref{HStau}.} $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$ for which $O$ observes $T_S(x)$ to be $\tau_S(x)$ for all $x\in S_n(y)\cap S$, and if $\{\ket{\xi_j'}:j\}$ is an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space of states\footnote{Thus,  $H'_{S_n,\tau'_S}$ is the subspace of states $\ket{\xi'}\in H'_{S_n}$ for which  $\hat{T}'_S(x')\ket{\xi'}=\tau'_S(x')\ket{\xi'}$  for all $x'\in S_n\cap S$. } $H'_{S_n,\tau_S'}$ for which $O'$ observes $T'_S(x')$ to be $\tau'_S(x')$ for all $x'\in S_n(y')\cap S$, then
\begin{equation}\label{kentlorentz}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\ev{\pi_n'\hat{T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(y')}{\Psi_n'}}{\ev{\pi_n'}{\Psi_n'}}=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\rho}\Lambda\indices{^\nu_\sigma} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\ev{\pi_n\hat{T}^{\rho\sigma}(y)}{\Psi_n}}{\ev{\pi_n}{\Psi_n}}
\end{equation}
where $\pi_n=\sum_j\dyad{\xi_j}$, $\pi_n'=\sum_j\dyad{\xi_j'}$, and $\ket{\Psi_n'}=U(\Lambda)\ket{\Psi_n}$. 

To see why (\ref{kentlorentz}) holds, we first recall that $\pi_n'$ will be independent of which orthonormal basis we choose for $H_{S_n,\tau_S'}$.\footnote{We showed this was the case for $\pi_n$ in footnote \ref{priproof} on page \pageref{priproof}.} Therefore, if we can show that $\{\ket{\xi_j'}\myeq U(\Lambda)\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $H_{S_n,\tau_S'}$, it will follow that $\pi_n'=U(\Lambda)\pi_nU(\Lambda)^{-1}$. 

That the elements of $\{U(\Lambda)\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ are orthonormal follows from the unitarity of $U(\Lambda)$ together with the orthonormality of  $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$. 
It remains for us to show that each $U(\Lambda)\ket*{\xi_j}\in H'_{S_n,\tau_S'},$ and that any $\ket*{\xi'}\in H'_{S_n,\tau_S'}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the $U(\Lambda)\ket*{\xi_j}$.

Well, first note that by (\ref{TUrelation}) and a calculation similar to (\ref{invariantTS1})
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\label{invariantTShat}
U(\Lambda)^{-1}\hat{T}'_S(x')U(\Lambda)&=U(\Lambda)^{-1}\hat{T}^{\prime\mu\nu}(x')\eta'_{\mu}(x')\eta'_{\nu}(x')U(\Lambda)\\
&=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\rho}\Lambda\indices{^\nu_\sigma}\hat{T}^{\rho\sigma}(x)\Lambda\indices{_\mu^\alpha}\eta_{\alpha}(x)\Lambda\indices{_\nu^\beta}\eta_{\beta}(x)\\
&=\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\rho}\Lambda\indices{_\mu^\alpha} \Lambda\indices{^\nu_\sigma}\Lambda\indices{_\nu^\beta}\hat{T}^{\rho\sigma}(x)\eta_{\alpha}(x)\eta_{\beta}(x)\\
&=\delta^\alpha_\rho\delta^\beta_\sigma \hat{T}^{\rho\sigma}(x)\eta_{\alpha}(x)\eta_{\beta}(x)\\
&=\hat{T}^{\alpha\beta}(x)\eta_{\alpha}(x)\eta_{\beta}(x)\\
&=\hat{T}_S(x)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
From (\ref{invariantTShat}), we see that  $U(\Lambda)\hat{T}_S(x)=\hat{T}'_S(x')U(\Lambda)$, so
$$
\hat{T}_S'(x')U(\Lambda)\ket{\xi_j}=U(\Lambda)\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\xi_j}=\tau_S(x)U(\Lambda)\ket{\xi_j}=\tau_S'(x')U(\Lambda)\ket{\xi_j}
$$
for all $x'\in S_n(y')\cap S$, where we have used the fact $\tau_S'(x')=\tau_S(x)$ since $T_S(x)$ is a scalar. Therefore, $U(\Lambda)\ket{\xi_j}\in H'_{S_n,\tau_S'}$. 

Now suppose that $\ket{\xi'}$ is a state for which $O'$ observes $T'_S(x')$ to be $\tau'_S(x')$ for all $x'\in S_n(y')\cap S$, i.e.  $\hat{T}_S'(x')\ket{\xi'}=\tau_S'(x')\ket{\xi'}$. From (\ref{invariantTShat}) we see that  $\hat{T}_S(x)U(\Lambda)^{-1}=U(\Lambda)^{-1}\hat{T}'_S(x')$, so
\begin{equation}\label{TSUxi}
\begin{split}
\hat{T}_S(x)U(\Lambda)^{-1}\ket{\xi'}&= U(\Lambda)^{-1} \hat{T}_S'(x')\ket{\xi'}\\
&=\tau_S'(x')U(\Lambda)^{-1}\ket{\xi'}\\
&=\tau_S(x)U(\Lambda)^{-1}\ket{\xi'}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where on the last line we have used the fact that $T_S(x)$ is a scalar. Therefore, $U(\Lambda)^{-1}\ket{\xi'}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis elements $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ of $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$, and hence  $\ket{\xi'}$  can be expressed as a linear combination of $\{U(\Lambda)\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$. 




Thus, we see that $\{\ket{\xi_j'}\myeq U(\Lambda)\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ is a spanning orthonormal subset of $H'_{S_n,\tau_S'}$, so it must therefore be an orthonormal basis of $H'_{S_n,\tau_S'}$. From this it follows that $\pi_n'=U(\Lambda)\pi_nU(\Lambda)^{-1}$. Therefore, 
\begin{equation}\label{kentlorentz2}
\begin{split}
\frac{\ev{\pi_n'\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y')}{\Psi_n'}}{\ev{\pi_n'}{\Psi_n'}}&=\frac{\ev{U(\Lambda)^{-1}U(\Lambda)\pi_nU(\Lambda)^{-1}\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y')U(\Lambda)}{\Psi_n}}{\ev{U(\Lambda)^{-1}U(\Lambda)\pi_n U(\Lambda)^{-1}U(\Lambda)}{\Psi_n}}\\
&=\frac{\ev{\pi_nU(\Lambda)^{-1}\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y')U(\Lambda)}{\Psi_n}}{\ev{\pi_n}{\Psi_n}}\\
&=\frac{\ev{\pi_n\Lambda\indices{^\mu_\rho}\Lambda{^\nu_\sigma}\hat{T}^{\rho\sigma}(y)}{\Psi_n}}{\ev{\pi_n }{\Psi_n}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where on the last line we have used (\ref{TUrelation}). Thus, equation (\ref{kentlorentz}) holds, and hence Kent's model is Lorentz invariant.

Note that in this proof of Lorentz invariance, we don't need to take the limit of $S_n$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. That is, we could remove the $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}$ from equation (\ref{kentconsistency0}) and consider a particular $S_n$, and the corresponding $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ would still be a rank-two tensor. Butterfield tells us that Kent's theory is  Lorentz invariant because his algorithm respects the light cone structure of $y$.\footnote{See \cite[30]{Butterfield}.} However, this statement could be slightly misleading because we don't need to consider the subset $S^1(y)\subset S$ of locations outside the light cone of $y$ in order to obtain a Lorentz invariant model. Doing the calculation on any Tomonaga-Schwinger spacelike hypersurface is sufficient to guarantee Lorentz invariance since any such spacelike hypersurface (e.g. $S_n$) is not altered at all by a Lorentz transformation -- only its coordinate description changes under a Lorentz transformation, and so the additional information of the scalar $\tau_S(x)$ on $S_n\cap S$ is Lorentz invariant. The only reason we need to consider the limit $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}S_n$ and hence $S^1(y)=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}S_n\cap S$ is that it is only in the limit that we use all the available information in $\tau_S(x)$ to calculate $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$. 


\section{Kent's Theory\label{Kentdecoherencesection} and Decoherence Theory\textsuperscript{*}}
In section \ref{probOutcomes} we saw that decoherence theory by itself does not offer a solution to the problem of outcomes. In this section, we consider how the additional information in Kent's theory is sufficient to address this problem. We will explain this by again considering  Kent's toy model discussed in section \ref{toysection}.

We thus suppose that a system is in a superposition $\psi_0^\text{sys} = c_1\psi_1^\text{sys}+c_2\psi_2^\text{sys}$ of two local states $\psi_1^\text{sys}$ and $\psi_2^\text{sys}$ where $\abs{c_1}^2+\abs{c_2}^2=1$, and that there is a photon coming in from the left that interacts with the system.\footnote{As in footnote \ref{wavefunctionfootnote} on page \pageref{wavefunctionfootnote}, we write $\psi_i^\text{sys}$ for the wave function that corresponds to the state $\ket*{\psi_i^\text{sys}(t)}$ with $\psi_i^\text{sys}(z, t)=\ip{z}{\psi_i^\text{sys}(t)}$.} We also suppose that  $y_1$ is a spacetime location with spatial location $z_1$ between the two spacelike hypersurfaces $S_0$ and $S$, and we consider a spacelike hypersurface $S_n=S_n(y_1)$  in a sequence of spacelike hypersurfaces that each contain $y_1$ as described on page \pageref{siydef}. 

In order to obtain a sufficiently simple description of the state $\ket{\Psi_n}\in H_{S_n}$ of $S_n$ for which we can use the formula (\ref{kentconsistency0}) to calculate Kent's beable, we will  
use a coarse-grained model so that $S_n$ is treated as a mesh of tiny cells\footnote{For a more detailed discussion of coarse-graining, see pp. \pageref{meshref} ff.} labeled by a sequence $(y_k)_{k=1}^\infty$. Thus, for each cell $y_k$ there will be a Hilbert space $H_k$ describing the state of that cell. We can think of each of these $y_k$ as systems that can become entangled with one another, but we will assume that $y_1$ is entangled with only a finite number $M$ of the other $y_k$ which we label as $y_{k_1}, \ldots, y_{k_M}$. What this means is that the most general expression for $\ket{\Psi_n}$ will be of the form
\begin{equation}\label{Sistate}
\ket{\Psi_n}=\Big(\sum_j\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}^M} c_{j,n}\ket{\xi_{1,j}}\prod_{l=1}^{M}\ket{\xi_{k_{l},n_l}}\Big)\ket*{\Xi}.
\end{equation}
In this expression, $\{\ket{\xi_{1,j}}:j\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $H_1$, $\mathbb{N}^M$ means the set of all lists $(n_1,\ldots,n_M)$ with each $n_l\in\mathbb{N}$ where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of positive integers greater than 0. The set of states $\{\ket{\xi_{k_{l},m}}:m\in\mathbb{N}\}$ form an orthonormal basis of $H_{k_{l}}$ for each $k_l$, and the $k_{l}$ are all distinct from each other and from $1$. Also, $M$ is chosen to be as small as possible so that any common factors of $\ket{\Psi_n}$ belong to $\ket*{\Xi}$ which is a sum of states of the form $\prod_l\ket{\xi_{\kappa_l}}$ where the states $\ket{\xi_{\kappa_l}}\in H_{\kappa_l}$ range over all the cells of $S_n$ not included in the set $\{k_{l}:l=1,\ldots,M\}.$ We also assume that each summand $c_{j,n}\ket{\xi_{1,j}}\prod_{l=1}^{M}\ket{\xi_{k_{l},n_l}}\ket*{\Xi}$ of $\ket*{\Psi_n}$ contains a state in each $H_k$ for every cell $k$ of $S_n$. In other words, if $k\neq 1$ and does not belong to the set $\{k_{l}:l=1,\ldots,M\}$, then $k$ belongs to the set $\{\kappa_l:\text{ there exists }\ket*{\xi_{\kappa_l}}\in H_{\kappa_l}\text{ appearing in }\ket*{\Xi}.\}$. Also, we will give $H_{S_n}$ an inner product so that if 
$$ \ket{\Psi_n'}=\Big(\sum_j\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}^M} c'_{j,n}\ket{\xi_{1,j}}\prod_{l=1}^{M}\ket{\xi_{k_{l},n_l}}\Big)\ket*{\Xi'},$$ then
$$\ip{\Psi_n'}{\Psi_n}=\Big(\sum_j\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}^M} \overline{c'_{j,n}}c_{j,n} \Big) \ip{\Xi'}{\Xi}$$
where $\ip{\Xi'}{\Xi}$ is defined in the obvious way. With this inner product, we will assume that $\ket{\Psi_n}$ is appropriately normalized so that $\ip{\Psi_n}{\Psi_n}=1$. If we also assume that  $\ip{\Xi}{\Xi}=1$, it will follow that $\sum_j\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}^M}\abs{c_{j,n}}^2=1.$

Now in order to see how Kent's model addresses the problem of outcomes, we will need to consider several scenarios from his toy model. In each scenario, we will use the decomposition (\ref{Sistate}) of $\ket{\Psi_n}$ to calculate the reduced density matrix that encapsulates all the information needed to calculate expectation values at different spacetime locations. 

First, consider Figure \ref{kentdeco1} which depicts the spacelike hypersurface $S_n(y^a_1)$ for a spacetime location $y^a_1$ that occurs before the photon has interacted with the system.

\caption{Depiction of a superposition of two local states at $z_1$ and $z_2$ before the photon has interacted with them. The gray squares indicate cells in $S^1(y^a_1)$ whose states are among the summands in (\ref{Sistate}) rather than in $\Xi$. The white square indicates a cell in $S_n(y^a_1)$ whose state is a factor in $\Xi$.}
\label{kentdeco1}
\end{figure}

The gray squares correspond to the summands that appear in (\ref{Sistate}). If the system were in the $\psi_1^\text{sys}$-state, then the state describing $S_n(y^a_1)$ would have a factor $\ket{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\in H_1$ indicating that there is a 
non-zero mass at the $y^a_1$-cell, and there would also be a factor $\ket{0_2}\in H_2$ which we use to indicate that there is zero mass/energy at $y^a_2$. 
There is also an incoming photon at the $y^a_3$-cell, and so we use $\ket{\gamma_3}$ to indicate that there is a photon there.
 Thus, if  the system  were in the $\psi_1^\text{sys}$-state, we would write the state of $S_n(y^a_1)$ 
 as $\ket{\Psi_n}=\ket{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket{0_2}\ket{\gamma_3}\ket*{\Xi'}$, where $\ket*{\Xi'}$ describes the states of all the other cells of $S_n(y^a_1)$. In this very simple scenario, $\ket*{\Xi'}=\prod_{k\neq 1,2,3}\ket{0_k}$ indicating that there is zero mass/energy at all the other $y_k$.

 On the other hand, if the system were in the state $\psi_2^\text{sys}$, then the state describing $S_n(y^a_1)$ would have a factor $\ket{\psi_2^\text{sys}}\in H_2$ 
 indicating that there is a non-zero mass at the $y^a_2$-cell, and there would also be a factor $\ket{0_1}\in H_1$ which we use to indicate that there is zero mass at $y^a_1$,
  and again the $y^a_3$-cell would be in the $\ket{\gamma_3}$-state, and every other cell would be described by  $\ket*{\Xi'}$  just as if the system had been in the $\psi_1^\text{sys}$-state. Therefore, when the system is in the state $\psi_2^\text{sys}$, we would write the state of $S_n(y^a_1)$ as $\ket{\Psi_n}=\ket{0_1}\ket{\psi_2^\text{sys}}\ket{\gamma_3}\ket*{\Xi'}$. 
 
 Now since the system is actually in a supposition $\psi_0^\text{sys} = c_1\psi_1^\text{sys}+c_2\psi_2^\text{sys}$, the state of $S_n(y^a_1)$ will be 
 \begin{equation*}
 \ket{\Psi_n}=\big(c_1\ket{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket{0_2}+c_2\ket{0_1}\ket{\psi_2^\text{sys}}\big)\ket{\gamma_3}\ket*{\Xi'}=\big(c_1\ket{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket{0_2}+c_2\ket{0_1}\ket{\psi_2^\text{sys}}\big)\ket*{\Xi}
 \end{equation*}
where we have absorbed the $\ket{\gamma_3}$-state into $\ket*{\Xi}$ (i.e. $\ket*{\Xi}= \ket{\gamma_3}\ket*{\Xi'}$).

Now as it stands, the state $\ket{\Psi_n}$ describing $S_n(y^a_1)$ has a definite mass-energy density $\tau_S(x)$ for $x\in S_n(y^a_1)\cap S$, namely $0$. Thus, if $\pi_n$ is the operator featuring in (\ref{kentconsistency0}) that corresponds to this definite mass-energy density, then $\pi_n\ket{\Psi_n}=\ket{\Psi_n}$. Therefore, equation (\ref{kentconsistency0}) for Kent's beables tells us that
\begin{equation}\label{kentbeablenoinfo}
\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y^a_1)}_{\tau_S}=\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^a_1)}{\Psi_n},
\end{equation}
where we have also used the fact that $\ip*{\Psi_n}{\Psi_n}=1.$

Now as we saw in section \ref{decotheory}, if we are interested only in the expectation values of observables for a system $\mathcal{S}$ contained within a universe $\mathcal{U}=\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{E}$, then the information needed to do this can be encapsulated in the reduced density matrix for $\mathcal{S}$. Thus, if the universe is described by a state 
$\ket{\Psi}=\sum_j c_j \ket{\psi_j}_\mathcal{S}\ket{E_j}_\mathcal{E}$ with corresponding density matrix $\hat{\rho}=\dyad{\Psi}\in M(H_\mathcal{U})$, then the reduced density matrix $\hat{\rho}_\mathcal{S}\in M(H_\mathcal{S})$ is the Hermitian operator acting on the state space $H_\mathcal{S}$ with the property that 
\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{reducedev} revisited}
\ev*{\hat{O}_\mathcal{U}}_\rho=\Tr_\mathcal{S}(\hat{\rho}_\mathcal{S}\hat{O}_\mathcal{S})
\end{equation}
where $\hat{O}_\mathcal{S}$ is an observable on $H_\mathcal{S}$,  and $\hat{O}_\mathcal{U}$ is the corresponding observable on $H_\mathcal{U}$. Furthermore, we also have
\begin{equation}\label{reduced2}
\hat{\rho}_\mathcal{S}=\sum_j \abs{c_j}^2\dyad{\psi_j}+\sum_{j\neq k} c_j\overline{c_k}\ip{E_k}{E_j}\dyad{\psi_j}{\psi_k}.\protect\footnotemark
\end{equation}
\footnotetext{cf. (\ref{reduced})}We can thus apply this to the situation at hand by taking $S_n$ to be our universe $\mathcal{U}$ and $y^a_1$ to be the system $\mathcal{S}$, and $S_n\setminus \{y^a_1\}$ to be the environment $\mathcal{E}$. If we assume that $\ip{0_2}{\psi_2^\text{sys}}= 0$, then by (\ref{reduced2}), the corresponding reduced density matrix $\hat{\rho}_{y^a_1}$ takes the form of an improper mixture
\begin{equation}\label{kentred}
\hat{\rho}_{y^a_1}= \abs{c_1}^2\dyad{\psi_1^\text{sys}}+\abs{c_2}^2\dyad{0_1}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, by (\ref{kentbeablenoinfo}) and (\ref{kentred}), Kent's beable at $y^a_1$ will take the form 
\begin{equation}\label{kentbe}
\begin{split}
\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y^a_1)}_{\tau_S}&= \ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^a_1)}{\Psi_n} \\
&=\Tr_{y^a_1}(\hat{\rho}_{y^a_1}\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^a_1))\\
&=\abs{c_1}^2\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^a_1)}{\psi_1^\text{sys}}+\abs{c_2}^2\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^a_1)}{0_1}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
But since $\hat{\rho}_{y^a_1}$ is an improper mixture, we cannot give (\ref{kentbe}) an ignorance interpretation -- the universe is still in the superposition state
$$\ket{\Psi_n}=c_1 \ket*{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket*{E_1}+c_2 \ket*{0_1}\ket*{E_2}$$ where $\ket{E_1}=\ket{0_2}\ket*{\Xi}$ and $\ket{E_2}=\ket{\psi_2^\text{sys}}\ket*{\Xi}$. 

In order to solve the problem of outcomes, we need to provide a satisfactory explanation (i.e. an explanation that is consistent with special relativity and the predictions of standard quantum theory)  of how the superposition state $\ket{\Psi_n}$ effectively goes to either the state $\ket*{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket*{E_1}$ or to the state $\ket*{0_1}\ket*{E_2}$.\footnote{cf. the initial discussion of the problem of outcomes on page \pageref{proboutcomes}. I have used the word `effectively' to qualify this sentence since it is not necessary to prove that there actually is such a transition from the state  $\ket{\Psi_n}$ to either the state $\ket*{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket*{E_1}$ or to the state $\ket*{0_1}\ket*{E_2}$. Rather, it is sufficient to show that if we consider any observable $\hat{O}_{\mathcal{S}}$ acting on $\mathcal{S}$, then the expectation value takes the form $\ev*{\hat{O}_{\mathcal{S}}}{\psi_1^\text{sys}}$ or $\ev*{\hat{O}_{\mathcal{S}}}{0_1}$ once there is an outcome, for then the system $\mathcal{S}$ has all the properties consistent with it being in the state $\ket*{\psi_1^\text{sys}}$ or the state $\ket*{0_1}$ respectively.} In terms of density operators, this means we need to show how the improper state (\ref{kentred}), transitions to a pure state of the form $\dyad{\psi_1^\text{sys}}$ or $\dyad{0_1}$.  

To this end, let us consider Kent's beables at the spacetime location $y^b_1$ depicted in figure \ref{kentdecoh2}.

\label{kentdecoh2}
\end{figure}The state of $S_n(y^b_1)$ will then be
 \begin{equation*}
 \ket{\Psi_n}=\big(c_1\ket{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket{0_2}\ket{\gamma_3}\ket{0_4}+c_2\ket{0_1}\ket{\psi_2^\text{sys}}\ket{0_3}\ket{\gamma_4}\big)\ket*{\Xi}
 \end{equation*}
 where the notation is analogous to that in the previous example. Since no photon detections are registered on $S_n(y^b_1)\cap S$, we again have $\pi_n\ket{\Psi_n}=\ket{\Psi_n}$ so that the reduced density matrix $\hat{\rho}_{y_1^b}$ will again be given by  (\ref{kentred}) with $y^a_1$ replaced by $y^b_1$. However, in this case, Kent's beables $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y^b_1)}_{\tau_S}$ will not be given by (\ref{kentbe}) because in the limit as $n\rightarrow\infty$, the photon \emph{will} be registered on $S_n(y^b_1)\cap S$. 
 
 To deal with the case when a photon is registered on $S_n(y^b_1)\cap S$, we consider a third example as depicted in figure \ref{kentdecoh3}.

\caption{Depiction of a superposition of two local states at $z_1$ and $z_2$ with $y^c_1$ sufficiently late that the photon intersects $S_n(y^c_1)\cap S$. The gray squares indicate cells in $S^1(y^c_1)$ whose states are among the summands in (\ref{Sistate})}
\label{kentdecoh3}
\end{figure}

In this case, the state of $S_n(y^c_1)$ will be
 \begin{equation*}
 \ket{\Psi_n}=\big(c_1\ket{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket{0_2}\ket{\gamma_3}\ket{0_4}+c_2\ket{0_1}\ket{\psi_2^\text{sys}}\ket{0_3}\ket{\gamma_4}\big)\ket*{\Xi}
 \end{equation*}
 but now we have to consider the fact that the photon intersects $S_n(y^c_1)\cap S$. There are two possible (notional) measurement outcomes that can occur on $S_n(y^c_1)\cap S$: either $T_S=\tau_{S,1}$ where $\tau_{S,1}(y^c_3)\neq 0$, or $T_S=\tau_{S,2}$ where $\tau_{S,2}(y^c_3)=0.$ 
 
 The case  $T_S=\tau_{S,1}$ indicates that there is a photon detection at $y^c_3$ so that the local state at the $y^c_3$-cell is $\ket{\gamma_3}$. Therefore, if we write $\pi_{n,1}$ for the operator $\pi_n$, we have 
 $$\pi_{n,1}\ket{\Psi_n}=c_1\ket{\psi_1^\text{sys}}\ket{0_2}\ket{\gamma_3}\ket{0_4}\ket*{\Xi}.$$
 Therefore, 
 $\ev*{\pi_{n,1}\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^c_1)}{\Psi_n}=\abs{c_1}^2\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^c_1)}{\psi_1^\text{sys}}$ and  $\ev*{\pi_{n,1}}{\Psi_n}=\abs{c_1}^2$. Hence, by (\ref{kentconsistency0}), Kent's beables at $y^c_1$ will be 
 $$\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y^c_1)}_{\tau_{S,1}}=\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^c_1)}{\psi_1^\text{sys}}.$$ 
 From this, it follows that the reduced density matrix at $y^c_1$ will take the form of a pure state:
 \begin{equation}\label{purerho}
\hat{\rho}_{y^c_1}= \dyad{\psi_1^\text{sys}}.
\end{equation} 
 On the other hand, for the case when  $T_S=\tau_{S,2}$, this indicates that there is no photon detection at $y^c_3$, so that the local state at the $y^c_3$-cell will be $\ket{0_3}$. So if we now  write $\pi_{n,2}$ for the operator $\pi_n$, we have 
 $$\pi_{n,2}\ket{\Psi_n}=c_2\ket{0_1}\ket{\psi_2^\text{sys}}\ket{0_3}\ket{\gamma_4}\ket*{\Xi}.$$
 Therefore, 
 $\ev*{\pi_{n,2}\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^c_1)}{\Psi_n}=\abs{c_2}^2\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^c_1)}{0_1}$ and  $\ev*{\pi_{n,2}}{\Psi_n}=\abs{c_2}^2$,  
  and so by (\ref{kentconsistency0}), Kent's beables at $y^c_1$ will be 
 $$\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y^c_1)}_{\tau_{S,2}}=\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y^c_1)}{0_1}.$$
 In this case, the reduced density matrix at $y^c_1$  will be
  \begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_{y^c_1}= \dyad{0_1},
\end{equation} 
which is again a pure state.

In these examples we have therefore seen how the additional information concerning photon detection on $S_n(y_1)\cap S$ is able to determine whether the reduced density matrix at $y_1$ is a pure state or an improper mixture. Hence, Kent's theory offers an answer to d'Espagnat's problem of outcomes. As mentioned in section \ref{probOutcomes}, d'Espagnat noticed that with decoherence theory alone, we are not entitled to give an ignorance interpretation to the reduced density matrix for a system that is an improper mixture, and thus we are not able to conclude that an outcome has occurred. However, if the reduced density matrix of a system goes from being an improper mixture to a pure state of the form $\dyad{\psi}$ as it does when Kent's additional information is taken into account, then we can say that an outcome has occurred, namely the outcome of the system being in the state $\ket{\psi}.$  




\section{Butterfield's Analysis of Outcome Independence  in Kent's theory\label{butterfieldtoy}}
Let us now consider Kent's theory in the light of Shimony's notion of Outcome Independence (OI)  as defined in section \ref{OISec}. 

Butterfield\footnote{See \cite[30-32]{Butterfield}} tries to answer the question of whether OI holds in Kent's theory by considering an example that builds on Kent's toy model. Butterfield's example is designed to capture the salient features of a Bell experiment where two spatially separated observers always observe opposite outcomes of some measurement. Following Kent, Butterfield thus considers a universe in one spatial dimensional. In this universe, there are two entangled systems, a left-system and a right-system as depicted in figure \ref{ButterfieldOI}.

	\caption{Butterfield's thought experiment for analyzing OI}
	\label{ButterfieldOI}
	\end{figure}

Two locations $z_1$ and $z_2$ with $z_2>z_1$ belong to a left-system, and there are two possible outcomes for a measurement on the left-system: either all the mass/energy of the left-system is localized at $z_1$ or all the mass/energy of the left-system  is localized at $z_2$. These two possibilities are analogous to a spin up or a spin down measurement outcome in a Stern-Gerlach statement. Likewise, two locations $z_3$ and $z_4$ with $z_3<z_4$ and $z_3\gg z_2$ belong to a right-system, and again, there are two possible measurement outcomes: either all the mass/energy of the right-system is localized at $z_3$ or all the mass/energy of the right-system  is localized at $z_4$. 

The initial joint state of the two systems is 
$a \ket*{\psi_1}\ket*{\psi_4} +b \ket*{\psi_2}\ket*{\psi_3}.$
This means that the left-system will be found to be localized at $z_1$ with probability $\abs{a}^2$, and at $z_2$ with probability $\abs{b}^2$, and if the left-system is localized at $z_1$, the  right system must be localized at $z_4$, whereas if the left-system is localized at $z_2$, then the right system must be localized at $z_3$.  

Now Butterfield supposes that there are two photons, one coming in from the left that interacts with the left system, and one coming in from the right that interacts with the right system. As in Kent's toy model, there is a late time spacelike hypersurface $S$, on which the photons are ``measured''. Since the joint state of the two systems  is in superposition, there will be two possible measurement outcomes for the two photons that arrive at $S$. Either the left-photon is measured at $\gamma_1$ and the right-photon is measured at $\gamma_4$, or the left-photon is measured at $\gamma_2$ and the right photon is measured at $\gamma_3$. Thus, if we suppose that the (notional) measurement for $T_S(x)$ yields an energy distribution $\tau_S(x)$ that is nonzero at $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_4$, but is zero at $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, then we can say that the outcome of the measurement on the two systems is that the left system is localized at $z_1$ and the right system is localized at $z_4$. Moreover, the probability of this outcome is $1$ given that the (notional) measurement of $T_S(x)$ on $S$ is $\tau_S(x)$. In other words, this model is deterministic. But as we saw on page \pageref{OIdet}, if a model is deterministic, then OI must hold. This is the conclusion that Butterfield draws. 

Now if Kent's theory is to be consistent with special relativity, OI being satisfied might initially seem concerning. Indeed, we saw in section \ref{OISec} that OI implies the negation of PI, and the negation of PI is not consistent with special relativity.\footnote{At this point, one might make the following remark: the argument that a violation of PI constitutes a violation of relativity is based on the idea that if one knew the value of the hidden data, one could transmit messages at superluminal speed. But when the hidden data is grounded in data about the future hypersurface $S$, then the fact that if one knew this data, one could transmit messages superluminally should not be a cause for concern since all sorts of things become possible if you can know future contingents.
\vspace{1em}
\\
To this remark, there are two responses that one could make. Firstly, it would be somewhat misleading in the context of Kent's interpretation to say that a knowledge of data about $S$ implies a knowledge of future contingents since when calculating Kent's $T^{\mu\nu}(y)$-beables $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$, the only knowledge about the data of $S$ that is needed is for regions of $S$ outside the light cone of $y$, and whether this data is about something in the future or in the past is going to depend on what frame of reference one is in. Only when the data is within the light cone of $y$ will we be able to say categorically that knowledge of this data constitutes knowledge of future contingents. But Kent's beables are not dependent on such data.
\vspace{1em}
\\
Secondly, as mentioned on page \pageref{lambdaknowledge}, the main concern with a violation of PI is not simply the possibility of superluminal signally, but rather the possibility of the propatation of superluminal effects, of which superluminal signallying would be a very clear demonstration. But whether or not there is such a demonstration, a violation of PI seems to be saying that effects can be propagated superluminally, and this is unacceptable to adherents of relativity theory.} However, there is one salient feature of a Bell experiment that is not captured in Butterfield's scenario, namely, in a Bell experiment, one can perform different measurements.  PI and its negation only make sense when there are parameters that can be changed. Furthermore, in the proof that OI implies the negation of PI,\footnote{The proof  that determinism implies the negation of PI (on pages \pageref{bellinequality2} to \pageref{PIdeterminism}), also assumes that the choice of parameter is not determined by the hidden variable $\lambda$.} it is assumed that the choice of parameter is not determined by the hidden variable $\lambda$. If the choice of parameters was determined by $\lambda$, then for $\hat{a}\neq\hat{b}$, at least one of the probabilities $P_{\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{c}}}(\uvbp{a},\uvbp{c}),$ $P_{\lambda,\bm{\hat{c}},\bm{\hat{b}}}(\uvbp{c},\uvbp{b})$ or $P_{\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{b}}}(\uvbp{a},\uvbp{b})$ would not be well-defined.\footnote{If $\lambda$ \label{lambdadetermineprob} did determine the choice of measurements, either $P(\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{c}})=0$, $P(\lambda,\bm{\hat{c}},\bm{\hat{b}})=0$, or $P(\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{b}})=0$. So for example, if we thought of $P_{\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{b}}}(X,Y)$ as a conditional probability $P(X,Y|\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{b}})$, and the probability $P(\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{b}})=0$, then according to the definition of conditional probability,  $P(X,Y|\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{b}})=\frac{0}{0}.$} Even though Butterfield is only considering OI in his thought experiment, a proper analysis of OI shouldn't be undertaken without considering an experiment with parameters (e.g. knob settings that correspond to measurement axes of a Stern-Gerlach experiment). This is because the determination of whether OI holds will depend on what one counts as being the hidden variable data of a system, and we need the hidden variable of a system to be such that the notion of PI is well-defined. Otherwise, one's verdict on OI will be irrelevant to Shimony's analysis of why Bell's inequality fails to hold. 

In the next section I will discuss Leegwater's criteria for what one should count as being the hidden variable data of a system, and in the following section \ref{KentconsistentQT}, I will consider a toy model that takkes parameter settings into account.


\section{Hidden variables and the Colbeck-Renner theorem}
In this section we will consider hidden variables in the light of the Colbeck-Renner theorem. Roughly speaking, the Colbeck-Renner theorem says there are no hidden variables theories that are of interest to quantum physicists -- either the hidden variables will be redundant or the hidden variable theory will be incompatible with standard quantum physics. It might therefore seem that the Colbeck-Renner theorem presents a serious challenge to Kent's theory. However, the challenge really hinges on what criteria the data of a theory must satisfy for it to be classified as hidden variable data. A careful analysis of the kind of data Kent's theory relies on reveals that the Colbeck-Renner theorm is not as serious a challenge to Kent's theory as it first might seem. 

First we need to consider the criteria a set of data should satisfy if it is to be classified as hidden variable data of a physical system $\mathcal{S}$. The criteria we discuss below can be found either explicitly or implicitly in Leegwater's proof of the Colbeck-Renner theorem.\footnote{See \cite{LeegwaterGijs2016Aitf}} The first criterion we will discuss is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item all the information of $\lambda$ is about $\mathcal{S}$ so that a change in $\lambda$ corresponds to a change in the system $\mathcal{S}$.\label{hidden1}
\end{enumerate} 
Notice that Butterfield does not accept this criterion. Butterfield assumes that the hidden variables in Kent's theory consist in the outcome $\tau_S(x)$ of $T_S(x)$ over the whole of $S$. However, this assumption is going to cause difficulties in the context of Shimony's analysis. This is because in Kent's theory, the information in $\tau_S(x)$ over the whole of $S$ clearly would determine which parameters are chosen in a Bell experiment, for this information would determine where a silver atom coming out of a Stern-Gerlach apparatus would be detected on a detection screen (as depicted in figure \ref{rotate}), and from the position of this detection, one could determine the orientation of the magnetic field used in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. So if we stipulated that $\lambda=\tau_S$ is the hidden variable data of every system in Kent's theory, then Kent's theory wouldn't satisfy the preconditions necessary for defining OI and PI. This would make Kent's theory radically different from the pilot wave interpretation where one can define OI and PI because the hidden variables in the pilot wave interpretation, being the positions and momenta of the particles, are independent of the measurement choices. An unfortunate consequence of not being able to define OI and PI is that we wouldn't be able to evaluate Kent's theory in the light of Shimony's analysis of why Bell's inequality fails to hold. 

But it is not obvious that we should stipulate that $\lambda=\tau_S$ is the hidden variable data of every system in Kent's theory. Just because we give $\tau_S$ a single label $\lambda$, it doesn't follow that $\tau_S$ is a single piece of information. There is typically going to be a huge amount of information in $\tau_S$, and so for a given system $\mathcal{S}$, we should carefully discern  what collection of information in $\tau_S$ should be stipulated as being the hidden variable data $\lambda$ of $\mathcal{S}$, hence criterion \ref{hidden1}. Criterion \ref{hidden1} shouldn't be that difficult to satisfy, for if $\lambda$ contained information that could change without this corresponding to any change in $\mathcal{S}$, then we should be able to discard this irrelevant information when considering $\mathcal{S}$ and redefine what $\lambda$ should be for the system. 

In the pilot wave interpretation, the positions and momenta of the particles that constitute a system would fulfil criterion \ref{hidden1}. On the other hand, all the information in $\tau_S$ of Kent's theory would not fulfil this criterion unless, of course, $\mathcal{S}$ was the whole universe. So in order for Kent's theory to satisfy criterion \ref{hidden1}, we just need to discard the information of $\tau_S$ that is irrelevant to the system $\mathcal{S}$ that is being considered in order to obtain the appropriate hidden variable data $\lambda$. 

Note, however, that we don't insist that a difference in $\mathcal{S}$ entails a difference in $\lambda$. This is because a hidden-variables theory is envisaged as augmenting standard quantum theory. So in the case when $\mathcal{S}$ is not entangled with any other system, there will be a quantum state describing $\mathcal{S}$, and this quantum state can be other than it is (indicating that $\mathcal{S}$ can be in a different physical state)  whilst the hidden variable remains the same. We thus impose a second criterion for a hidden-variables theory:
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	\item \label{hidden3} If $\lambda$ is the hidden variable of a system $\mathcal{S}$ and if $\ket{\phi}$ is the quantum state of $\mathcal{S}$ or of some composite system $\mathcal{U}$ that contains $\mathcal{S}$ as a subsystem, then it is possible for there to be a different quantum state $\ket{\phi'}$ of $\mathcal{S}$ (or $\mathcal{U}$) while the hidden variable $\lambda$ remains unchanged, and it is possible for there to be a different hidden variable $\lambda$ while $\ket{\phi}$ remains unchanged.
\end{enumerate} 
This criterion is satisfied in the pilot wave interpretation, since the quantum state is the pilot wave itself. The pilot wave could be other than it is without any of the positions and momenta of the particles changing, but changing the pilot wave would result in a physical change of the system since the pilot wave governs how  the positions and the momenta of the particles subsequently evolve over time. We will discuss the failure of criterion \ref{hidden3} for Kent's theory at the end of this section.

Another criterion implicit in Leegwater's proof for a set of data $\lambda$ to constitute the hidden variable data of a system $\mathcal{S}$ is the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item \label{hidden2} it should be possible to change the measurement parameters when measuring $\mathcal{S}$ without this determining what $\lambda$ should be. 
\end{enumerate} 
It is worth noting that  we used criterion \ref{hidden2} when showing that OI implies the negation of PI. If this criterion doesn't hold, we cannot even begin to consider whether PI holds in a given theory. This is because the criterion for PI depends on the probability $P_{\lambda,\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{b}}}(\uvbpm{a},\uvbpm{b})$ being well-defined, but if the choice of $\bm{\hat{a}}$ or $\bm{\hat{b}}$ determines what $\lambda$ should be, then one wouldn't be able to define $P_{\lambda',\bm{\hat{a}},\bm{\hat{b}}}(\uvbpm{a},\uvbpm{b})$ for $\lambda'\neq\lambda$.\footnote{Cf. footnote \ref{lambdadetermineprob} on page \pageref{lambdadetermineprob}.} But even without any consideration of PI, a rejection of criterion \ref{hidden2} would still seem undesirable, for it would be rather strange if changing the choice of measurement parameters necessarily changed the hidden variable $\lambda$ of the system $\mathcal{S}$, and hence by criterion \ref{hidden1} the system $\mathcal{S}$ itself.\footnote{Of course, in the quantum world, strangeness is not necessarily an argument against something being true.} Moreover, if free will is real and the free choice of the measurement parameter was made before it was determined which system was going to be measured, then it wouldn't even be clear which $\lambda$ of which system we were talking about.\footnote{If the reality of free will is denied, then there wouldn't necessarily be this problem of associating the choice of measurement with the $\lambda$ of the system, because the physical state of the universe could determine which choice of measurement is going to be made as well as which system is going to be measured.}  

In the pilot wave interpretation, the positions and momenta of the particles that constitute a system would fulfil criterion \ref{hidden2}. In the case of Kent's interpretation, we would have to choose carefully the subset of $\tau_S$ for the $\lambda$ of the system being measured if criterion \ref{hidden2} is to hold. But it seems that this should be possible, for one can imagine just changing the part of $\tau_S$ that corresponded to where the measurement parameter dial/knob was without this changing Kent's stress-momentum tensor for the system being measured immediately before it interacts with the measurement device.   

Closely related to criterion \ref{hidden2} is the following criterion: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{3}
	\item \label{hidden5} There is a range of possible values $\lambda$ for a system $\mathcal{S}$, and for each possible value, we can assign a probability $p_\lambda$ that $\lambda$ obtains, and we can do so in such a way that $p_\lambda$ is independent of any choice of measurement that is to be made on $\mathcal{S}$.
\end{enumerate} 
Butterfield refers to criterion \ref{hidden5} as the `no-conspiracy' assumption, and it is one of the criteria assumed in the Colbeck-Renner theorem. However, Butterfield adds that `no-conspiracy' is a rather unfair label for this criterion since there wouldn't necessarily be anything conspiratorial if this assumption was violated.\footnote{See \cite[34]{Butterfield}.} But in saying this, Butterfield is envisaging $\lambda$ to be the whole of $\tau_S$, and this is in violation of criterion \ref{hidden1}. Since we can expect the whole of $\tau_S$ (together with the universal state $\ket*{\Psi_0}$) to determine Kent's stress-momentum tensor for the measurement parameter dial/knob, then we wouldn't expect criterion \ref{hidden5} to hold. But on the other hand, if we adopt criterion \ref{hidden1} and assume that only information relevant to $\mathcal{S}$ is included in the $\lambda$ for $\mathcal{S}$, then criterion \ref{hidden5} is more plausible. It ties in with common sense intuitions that scientists have free will and can make choices about which measurements they make, and that these choices are statistically independent of the states of the physical systems they are measuring. However, not everyone shares this intuition. If criterion \ref{hidden5} doesn't hold, then what a physical system does will depend on what property of this system one is about to measure. This kind of dependence is referred to as \textbf{superdeterminism}\index{superdeterminism}. Bell coined the term superdeterminism in a 1983 BBC interview, where he said:  
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{}
	\begin{displayquote}
		There is a way to escape the inference of superluminal speeds and spooky action at a distance. But it involves absolute determinism in the universe, the complete absence of free will. Suppose the world is superdeterministic, with not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behavior, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined, including the ``decision'' by the experimenter to carry out one set of measurements rather than another, the difficulty disappears.
	\end{displayquote}
\end{adjustwidth}
However, Sabine Hossenfelder disputes Bell's argument that the only way to escape the inference of superluminal speeds and spooky action at a distance is to violate free will. Rather, all that is needed to escape this inference is a violation of the statistical independence of the choice of measurement parameters and the state of the system being measured, and this violation is what Hossenfelder takes to be superdeterminism.\footnote{ See \cite{superdeterminism}.   }


\begin{comment}

more reasonable. For example, in the case where the choice is made before it is determined which  system is to be measured, and the system  if wouldn't be clear $\lambda$ for which system would be affected
For if this probability $p_\lambda$ did depend on the choice that was to be made on the system, then we could  envisage a system $\mathcal{S}$ consisting of two entangled particles which Alice and Bob measure separately. If Bob's choice of measurement affected the probability distribution of $p_\lambda$, then it would seem that the effect of Bob's measurement could propagate to Alice faster than the speed of light.\footnote{Recall from the discussion on page \pageref{lambdaknowledge}, that in considering any possible violation of relativity,   it is irrelevant whether Alice knows the hidden variable $\lambda$ and hence whether Alice could work out which measurement Bob had made, because Alice's state of knowledge shouldn't have any effect on the speed at which Bob's effect is propagated. But if she did know $\lambda$, after enough measurements, she would be able to work out the distribution $p_\lambda$, and so if this distribution depended on Bob's choice, she would be able to say something about the choice he made.} Adherents of relativity theory would therefore not want to reject criterion \ref{hidden5}.


We should also state explicitly a fifth criterion for hidden variables as a condition for the possibility :
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{4}
	\item \label{hidden5} Suppose  $\mathcal{A}$ is any system that is entangled with $\mathcal{S}$, and that the quantum state of the composite system $\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}$  is $\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}$. Then for any measurement $O_\mathcal{S}$ on $\mathcal{S}$ and $O_\mathcal{A}$ on $\mathcal{A}$, there is a probability for the joint measurement of $O_\mathcal{S}$ and $O_\mathcal{A}$ on $\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}$ that is a function of $\lambda$  despite $\lambda$ only referring to the system $\mathcal{S}$.	
\end{enumerate}
\end{comment}

In addition to these four criteria for the hidden variable data $\lambda$ of a system $\mathcal{S}$, it is also desirable for a hidden-variables theory to satisfy PI and empirical adequacy. We defined PI for a two-outcome measurement on page \pageref{PIdef}, but it is easy to generalize the definition of PI for measurements with more than two outcomes. In this more generalized setting, we suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is any system that is entangled with the system $\mathcal{S}$, and that the quantum state of the composite system $\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}$  is $\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}$. We also suppose that $O_{\mathcal{S}}$ and $O_{\mathcal{A}}$ represent measurement procedures on $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ respectively, and that $o_{\mathcal{S}}$ and $o_{\mathcal{S}}$ represent particular measurement outcomes respectively. For a hidden variable $\lambda$ for the system $\mathcal{S}$,\footnote{Although Leegwater, in his proof of the Colbeck-Renner theorem assumes that $\lambda$ is a hidden variable for the system $\mathcal{S}$ only, it looks like the proof would still go through if $\lambda$ was a hidden variable for the composite system $\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}$.} there will be a probability $P_\lambda^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \, O_\mathcal{A}=o_\mathcal{A})$ (understandable in a frequentist sense) that the measurement outcomes of $O_{\mathcal{S}}$ and $O_{\mathcal{A}}$ will be $o_{\mathcal{S}}$  and $o_{\mathcal{A}}$ respectively. Given a second measurement procedure $O_{\mathcal{A}}'$ on $\mathcal{A}$, PI states that
\begin{equation}\tag{PI}
	\sum_{\substack{o_\mathcal{A}\text{ an }\\ \text{outcome }\\ 
	 \text{of }O_{\mathcal{A}}}}P_\lambda^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \,O_\mathcal{A}=o_\mathcal{A}) = \sum_{\substack{o_\mathcal{A}'\text{ an}\\ \text{outcome }\\ 
	 \text{of }O_{\mathcal{A}}'}}P_\lambda^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \,O'_\mathcal{A}=o'_\mathcal{A}). 
\end{equation}
If PI holds, then we can define the probability
\begin{equation}
	P^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}_{\lambda}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S})=\sum_{\substack{o_\mathcal{A}\text{ an }\\ \text{outcome }\\ 
	\text{of }O_{\mathcal{A}}}}P_\lambda^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \,O_\mathcal{A}=o_\mathcal{A})
\end{equation}
that is independent of the measurement procedure $O_\mathcal{A}$ on $\mathcal{A}$.\footnote{Cf. (\ref{PIone}).}


As for the definition of \textbf{empirical adequacy}\index{empirical adequacy!formal definition} (EA),  this states that
\begin{equation}\tag{EA}\label{adeq}
	\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda}p_\lambda P_\lambda^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \,O_\mathcal{A}=o_\mathcal{A})=P^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \,O_\mathcal{A}=o_\mathcal{A})
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is the set of all hidden variables so that $\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda} p_\lambda = 1$, and where 
$$P^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \,O_\mathcal{A}=o_\mathcal{A})$$
 is the standard probability calculated using the Born Rule with the eigenstates of the observables $\hat{O}_\mathcal{S}$ and $\hat{O}_\mathcal{A}$ and the quantum state $\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}$. EA is essentially the same as equation (\ref{bohmconsistency}). It also has some similarities with (\ref{kentconsistency}), though the main difference is the range of the summation -- the index of the summands of (\ref{kentconsistency}) does not parametrize hidden variables that satisfy criteria \ref{hidden1} to \ref{hidden5} above.

Now, as I've been alluding to, criteria \ref{hidden1} to \ref{hidden5} together with the conditions of PI and EA are very restrictive. Leegwater proves a version of the Colbeck-Renner theorem\footnote{See \cite{LeegwaterGijs2016Aitf}.} which takes the following form: if one defines hidden variables according to criteria \ref{hidden1} to \ref{hidden5}, then in any hidden-variables theory for which PI and EA hold, the hidden variables are redundant. In other words, 
\begin{equation}\label{colbeckrenner}
P_\lambda^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \,O_\mathcal{A}=o_\mathcal{A})=P^{\ket{\phi}_{\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}}}(O_\mathcal{S}=o_\mathcal{S}\, \& \,O_\mathcal{A}=o_\mathcal{A})
\end{equation}
for any measurement $O_\mathcal{S}$ on $\mathcal{S}$ and $O_\mathcal{A}$ on $\mathcal{A}$.\footnote{Strictly speaking, we should say that equation (\ref{colbeckrenner}) holds for almost all $\lambda$, but we need not concern ourselves here with the details of measure theory that would be needed to make sense of this qualification.} 

Thus, the Colbeck-Renner theorem means that we cannot hope to make Kent's theory into a hidden-variables theory that satisfies criterion \ref{hidden1} to \ref{hidden5} as well as  PI and EA, for the information in Kent's theory is clearly non-redundant.

But nevertheless, it still seems that we should be able to make some kind of sense of PI and EA in Kent's theory and that we should be able to evaluate Kent's theory on the basis of whether these notions of PI and EA are true in this context. To achieve this aim, one strategy would be to relax one of the 
four criteria for a hidden variable. Since we still want to be able to make sense of PI and EA,  a process of elimination suggests that the most obvious hidden variable criterion to drop would be criterion \ref{hidden3}. 


If we drop criterion \ref{hidden3}, then instead of thinking of $\tau_S$ as an augmentation of standard quantum theory, we can think of $\tau_S$ as a rather elaborate way of stipulating the initial quantum states of experiments as well as the quantum states of measurement outcomes. In the next section, we will describe in some more detail how to extract the quantum state of a system from the universal quantum state $\ket*{\Psi_0}$ and $\tau_S$, but roughly speaking, if we consider an experimental setup including some measurement apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ and an object to be measured $\mathcal{S}$, then the information in  $\tau_S$ outside the light cone of the spacetime location of $\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}$ before they have interacted will determine the initial quantum states of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ before they interact, and likewise, the information in  $\tau_S$ outside the light cone of the spacetime location of $\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}$ after they have interacted will determine the quantum outcome states of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ after they have interacted. This will mean that when the information in $\tau_S$ that is about $\mathcal{S}$ changes, the quantum state of $\mathcal{S}$ will change, and hence criterion \ref{hidden3}. But the information of $\tau_S$ will be non-redundant, for without this information, we would only have the evolution of universal quantum state $\ket{\Psi_0}$ which would continually branch into many worlds. In the many worlds that resulted, the energy density on the spacelike hypersurface $S$ would not be in a definite state, but rather would be in a superposition of definite states. But with the information of $\tau_S$ one of these many states in this superposition is selected as actual. If we could then appropriately partition the information in $\tau_S(x)$ on the basis of whether it determined the quantum state of $\mathcal{S}$, or the quantum state of the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$, or the quantum state of the rest of the universe, we could then consider whether Kent's theory gave the same predictions as standard quantum theory. If it did, then PI and EA would hold in Kent's theory, since these both hold in standard quantum theory. And since Kent's theory is formulated in the Lorentz invariant setting of Schwinger and Tomonaga, this would mean that Kent's theory is a solution to the measurement problem! In other words, we would have a one-world interpretation of quantum physics which gave the same probabilities for experimental outcomes that standard quantum physics predicts, and under this interpretation, the physical world would possess the necessary symmetries that guarantee whatever frame of reference one was in, the speed of light would be constant.  

\section{Kent's Theory and standard quantum theory\textsuperscript{*}\label{KentconsistentQT}}
In this section, I will describe in more detail how to extract the quantum state of a system from the universal quantum state $\ket*{\Psi_0}$ and the mass-energy density $\tau_S$, and I will show that Kent's theory does indeed give the same predictions as standard quantum theory in the case of an experimental apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ measuring the properties of a particle $\mathcal{S}$. Again, we will consider a toy model in one dimension similar to Kent's toy model described in section \ref{toysection}.

So let $\tau_S$ be the notional mass-energy density measurement on $S$. In order to avoid undue complexity, we will assume that there is no simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate degeneracy so that if $\ket*{\Psi}$ and $\ket*{\Psi'}$ are normalized\footnote{In this section we will assume that all states are normalized.} simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstates with simultaneous eigenvalues $\tau_S$ and $\tau_S'$ respectively, then
$$(\forall x\in S) \,(\tau_S(x)=\tau_S'(x))\implies \ket*{\Psi}=\ket*{\Psi'}.$$
So corresponding to $\tau_S$, there will be a unique simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate $\ket*{\Psi}$, and according to the Born Rule, the notional mass-energy density measurement $\tau_S$ will have been selected with a probability 
$$P(T_S = \tau_S)=|\mel{\Psi}{U_{SS_0}}{\Psi_0}|^2$$
where $\ket*{\Psi_0}$ is the state of the initial hypersurface $S_0$, and where $U_{SS_0}$ is the unitary operator defined by equation (\ref{SchwingerUnitaryOP}).

Now suppose this notional measurement $\tau_S$ indicates that there is some apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ that exists in the vicinity of a spatial location $z_0$ at time $t_i$ as depicted in figure \ref{pisolution}.

	\caption{Depicts an experiment where the state of some photons $\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}$ and $\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}$ on the spacelike hypersurface $S$ determines the initial conditions of an experimental setup of a particle $\mathcal{S}$ and apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ in the vicinity of the spacetime location $(z_0, t_i)$.  The state of the photons $\gamma_f^{\prime}$ on the spacelike hypersurface $S$ determines the final state of the apparatus after the particle has left it at time $t_f$ so that the apparatus at time $t_m$ displays a definite measurement outcome. It is assumed that no incoming photons have become entangled with the experiment after the $\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}$ and $\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}$ photons and before the $\gamma_f^{\prime}$ photons have become entangled with the experiment.  }

This means that prior to $t_i$, the apparatus will have interacted with many photons so that the photon detections on $S$ outside the light cone of $y_i=(t_i, z_0)$ will indicate via Kent's stress-energy beables that there is some apparatus in the vicinity of $z_0$ that we can identify as $\mathcal{A}$. We further assume that Kent's stress-energy beables determine that $\mathcal{A}$ is in a state $\ket{a}$ which encapsulates among other things the measurement parameters of the apparatus.  We also suppose that the information in $\tau_S$ indicates that there is a particle $\mathcal{S}$ at time $t_i$ in a state
$\ket{s}$ that is heading towards the apparatus so that it will interact with it. This means that all the 
possible\footnote{i.e. possible given $\ket{\Psi_0}$ and the Born rule selection criterion.} 
simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstates on $S$ whose simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenvalues agree with $\tau_S$ for all $x\in S^1(y_i)$,\footnote{Recall from page \pageref{S2} that $S^1(y_i)$ is the subset of $S$ that is outside the light cone of $y_i$.} 
where  $y_i=(t_i, z_0)$, are such that their simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenvalues within the light cone of $y_i$ indicate that at some time after $t_i$ the particle $\mathcal{S}$ would have interacted
with the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$. 

At this point, it will be helpful to define a \textbf{simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate of a subregion}\index{simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate of a subregion} $U$ of $S$ to be a state $\ket{\Psi_U}\in H_U$  which is an eigenstate of $\hat{T}_S(u)$ for every $u\in U$, where $H_U$ is the Hilbert space of states describing $U$. We will assume that we can write any state of $H_S$ as a superposition of states of the form $\ket*{\Psi_U}\ket*{\Psi_{S\setminus U}}$, where $\ket{\Psi_U}\in H_U $ is  a simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate of the subregion $U$ of $S$, and $\ket*{\Psi_{S\setminus U}}\in H_{S\setminus U}$ is a simultaneous
$\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate of the subregion $S\setminus U$ of $S$.\footnote{We effectively made this assumption in equation (\ref{Sistate}).} We will accordingly let 
$\ket*{\gamma^{(S^1(y_i))}_i}$ denote the simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate of the subregion $S^1(y_i)$ of $S$ with simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenvalue $\tau_S(x)$ respectively for all $x\in S^1(y_i)$. Then any  simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate over the whole of $S$  whose simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenvalue agrees with 
$\tau_S$ on the subregion $S^1(y_i)$ will be expressible as
$\ket*{\gamma^{(S^1(y_i))}_i}\ket*{\Psi_{S\setminus S^1(y_i)}}$, 
and any such simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate will determine the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ and the particle $\mathcal{S}$ to exist in states $\ket{a}$ and $\ket{s}$ respectively given the state $\ket*{\Psi_0}$ of the initial hypersurface $S_0$. In figure \ref{pisolution}, rather than depicting $\ket*{\gamma^{(S^1(y_i))}_i}$, we depict the two components $\ket*{\gamma^{(\mathcal{S})}_i}$ and $\ket*{\gamma^{(\mathcal{A})}_i}$ of $\ket*{\gamma^{(S^1(y_i))}_i}$ which are simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstates for subregions of $S^1(y_i)$ where the states of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ are determined, so that 
$$\ket*{\gamma^{(S^1(y_i))}_i}=\ket*{\gamma^{(\mathcal{S})}_i}\ket*{\gamma^{(\mathcal{A})}_i}\ket*{\Xi^{(S^1(y_i))}_i}$$
where $\ket*{\Xi^{(S^1(y_i))}_i}$ is a simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate over the remainder of $S^1(y_i)$.

We also assume that there are no further interactions of $\mathcal{S}$ with photons that are registered on $S$ until the particle has finished interacting with the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$.  In making this assumption, we suppose that there is a time $t_f>t_i$ such that if the notional measurement on $S$ had resulted in the outcome $\tau_S^{(j)}$ rather than $\tau_S$ where $\tau_S^{(j)}(x)=\tau_S(x)$ for all $x\in S^1(y_i)$, then for all $x \in S^1(y_f,y_i)=S^1(y_f)\setminus S^1(y_i)$,\footnote{i.e $S^1(y_f,y_i)$ is the subset of $S$ that is within the light cone of $y_i=(t_i, z_0)$ but outside the light cone of $y_f=(t_f, z_0)$.} we would be able to say of the mass-energy density $\tau_S^{(j)}(x)$ at $x$ that it wasn't caused by a photon that had been reflected from $\mathcal{S}$.\footnote{This assumption of our toy model assumes that photons are sufficiently well-localized so that we can discern fairly precise trajectories. In physical reality, we can't expect photons to have this degree of localization, and so there will be some ambiguity about where the photons detected on $S$ came from.  } 

We will assume that given that the notional measurement restricted to $S^1(y_i)$ is $\tau_S$, there is sufficiently little interaction of the composite system $\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}$ with its environment so that we can assume it evolves unitarily in accordance with the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Therefore, given that the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ is in a state $\ket{a}$ that encapsulates its parameter settings, and the particle $\mathcal{S}$ is on course to interact with $\mathcal{A}$, we can express the state $\ket{s}$ of $\mathcal{S}$ as a superposition $\ket{s}=\sum_j c_j \ket{s_j}$ where $\{\ket{s_j}:j\}$ is the set of pointer states corresponding to the parameter settings of the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ that are encapsulated in the state $\ket{a}$. As described on page \pageref{pointer}, this means there are future states $\ket{a_j}$ of the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ such that $\ip{a_j}{a_{j'}}=0$ for $j\neq j'$,\footnote{Strictly speaking, $\ip{a_j}{a_{j'}}\approx 0$ for $j\neq j'$, but we will assume $\ip{a_j}{a_{j'}}=0$ in this toy model in order to avoid undue complexity.} and such that the composite system $\mathcal{S}+\mathcal{A}$ will evolve according to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation as
$$\ket{s_j}\ket{a}\rightarrow \ket{s_j}\ket{a_j} $$
for each pointer state $\ket{s_j}$, and hence
$$\ket{s}\ket{a}\rightarrow \sum_j c_j \ket{s_j}\ket{a_j}.$$

We will also assume that given that notional measurement restricted to $S^1(y_i)$ is $\tau_S$, there is a time interval between $t_f$ and $t_m > t_f$ during which photons will reflect off the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ and ultimately be detected at space time locations on the hypersurface $S$ that correspond to one of the definite measurement states $\ket{a_f}$ of the apparatus indicating that $\mathcal{S}$ is in the state $\ket{s_f}$. But whatever the  notional measurement on $S$ is, so long as it results in an outcome $\tau_S^{(j)}$ with $\tau_S^{(j)}(x)=\tau_S(x)$ for all $x\in S^1(y_i)$, then we're assuming that for all $x \in S^1(y_m,y_f),$\footnote{where $y_m=(t_m, z_0)$.} we would be able to say of the mass-energy density $\tau_S^{(j)}(x)$ at $x$ that it was caused by a photon that had been reflected from the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ being in some state $\ket{a_j}$ rather than one of the other states. We will let $S_{\mathcal{A}}$ denote the subregion of $S^1(y_m,y_f)$ where photons coming from the apparatus arrive and hence determine which state the apparatus  is in, and we will let $\ket*{\gamma'_j}$ denote the simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstate of the subregion $S_{\mathcal{A}}$ of $S$ that corresponds to the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ being in state $\ket{a_j}$.  We will also label the states on the subregion $S\setminus (S^1(y_i)\cup S_{\mathcal{A}})$ as $\ket{\Xi_l}$ so that we can express the state $\ket*{\Psi_S}=U_{SS_0}\ket*{\Psi_0}$ as a superposition
\begin{equation}\label{PsiSdecomp}
\ket*{\Psi_S}=b\ket*{\gamma_i^{(S^1(y_i))}}\sum_j c_j \ket*{\gamma_j'}\ket*{\Xi_j} +\sum_{k\neq 0} b_k\ket*{\gamma_k^{(S^1(y_i))}}\ket*{\Xi_k'}
\end{equation}
where the $\ket*{\gamma_k^{(S^1(y_i))}}$ for $k\neq i$ are simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenstates of the subregion $S^1(y_i)$ whose simultaneous $\hat{T}_S$-eigenvalues restricted to $S^1(y_i)$ are distinct from $\tau_S$, where $\ket*{\Xi_k'}$ are states of the subregion $S\setminus S^1(y_i)$, and where $b$  is a complex numbers whose modulus squared gives the probability that the notional measurement on $S^1(y_i)$ will be $\tau_S$, and likewise, the modulus squared of the $b_k$ give the probabilities of the other possible notional measurements on $S^1(y_i).$ 

Now we aim to show that within Kent's theory, we can calculate the probability the particle emerges from the measuring apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ in state $\ket{s_{f}}$ given that it enters $\mathcal{A}$ in state $\ket{s}$, and that this probability is the same as if one ignored $S$ and just applied the Born Rule to $\ket{s}$ and $\ket{s_f}$. 

In order to show this, let us choose a sequence of spacelike hypersurfaces $S_{n,i}$ which go through the spacetime location $y_i=(t_i, z_0)$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} S_{n,i}\cap S=S^1(y_i).$\footnote{We understand this limit by giving $S^1(y_i)$ and $S_{n,i}$  topologies that makes them locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space, and so by saying there is this limit of hypersurfaces, we mean that every point $u\in S^1(y_i)$ has a neighborhood $U\subset S^1(y_i)$ for which there is an integer $N$ such that $U\subset S_{n,i}$ for all $n\geq N$.} Let us assume that $n$ is sufficiently large so that the photons described by $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}$ and $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}$ belong to $S_{n,i}$. The spacelike hypersurface $S_{n,i}$ and the photons being reflected from the vicinity of $z_0$ just before time $t_i$ are  depicted in figure \ref{pisolution}.

With equation (\ref{PsiSdecomp}) in mind, we can express the quantum state $\ket{\Psi_{n,i}}=U_{S_{n,i},S_0}\ket{\Psi_0}$  of the spacelike hypersurface $S_{n,i}$ as a superposition 
\begin{equation}\label{Psinidecomp}
\ket{\Psi_{n,i}}=b\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}\ket{s}\ket{a}\ket{\xi_n}+\cdots.
\end{equation} 
The $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}$ component of the first summand of (\ref{Psinidecomp}) is extracted from the $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(S^1(y_i))}}$ component of (\ref{PsiSdecomp}) which we can do because we're assuming $S_{n,i}$ overlaps with $S$ in the subregion $S^1(y_i)$ corresponding to the states $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}$ and $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}$. Corresponding to the region in the vicinity of $y_i$ on $S_{n,i}$ we have the components $\ket{s}\ket{a}$ because we're assuming that the measurement of $\tau_S$ on $S^1(y_i)$ guarantees that $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ are in the states $\ket{s}$ and $\ket{a}$ respectively. The component $\ket{\xi_n}$ corresponds to the state of all the other regions of $S_{n,i}$ not determined by $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}$, $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}$, $\ket{s}$ or $\ket{a}$, and the ellipses correspond to the summation over $k$ term of (\ref{PsiSdecomp}).

If we now define the projection $\pi_{n,i}$ corresponding to the measurement outcome  $\tau_S(x)$ on $S_{n,i}\cap S$ as in equation (\ref{tauprojection}), then
\begin{equation}\label{piphi}
	\pi_{n,i}\ket{\Psi_{n,i}}\approx b\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}\ket{s}\ket{a}\ket{\xi_n}.
\end{equation}
  For convenience, we will omit the reference to $n$ and write $S_i$ for $S_{n,i}$, $\ket{\Psi_i}$ for $\ket{\Psi_{n,i}}$, and $\pi_i$ for $\pi_{n,i}$. We will also write $\ket{\Phi_i}$ for the normalized state of $\pi_i\ket{\Psi_i}$ so that 
 \begin{equation}\label{phii}
	\ket{\Phi_i}\approx \ket{s}\ket{a}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}.
\end{equation}

Now we're assuming that the measurement outcome $\tau_S$ on the whole of $S$ will determine the apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ to be in the state $\ket{a_f}$ by time $t_m$, and hence the particle $\mathcal{S}$ to be in the state $\ket{s_f}$, and $\tau_S$ will determine this outcome with probability $1$. However, if the the mass-energy density was only determined to be $\tau_S$ on $S^1(y_i)$, then the probability the apparatus and the particle would be found to be in the states $\ket{a_f}$ and $\ket{s_f}$ respectively at time $t_m$ would typically be less than $1$.
 
 To calculate this probability, we first consider the evolution of $\ket{\Phi_i}$ to $ U_{S_f,S_i}\ket{\Phi_{i}}$. It's possible that there may be photons ``measured'' on $S$ between the spacelike hypersurfaces $S_i$ and $S_f$ as indicated in figure \ref{pisolution} (i.e. on $(S\cap S_f)\setminus(S\cap S_i)$), but we are assuming that they do not get entangled with the different pointer states of the apparatus. In other words, $\ket{\Phi_i}$ will evolve to a state of the form 
\begin{equation}\label{USfievolve1}
	U_{S_f,S_i}\ket{\Phi_{i}}\approx \sum_j c_j\ket{s_j}\ket{a_j}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}\sum_kg_k\ket{\gamma'_k},
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\gamma_k'}$ correspond to the possible measurements of $T_S(x)$  on $(S\cap S_f)\setminus(S\cap S_i)$, and $\sum_k\abs{g_k}^2=1$.

But from time $t_f$ to $t_m$, we assume that the apparatus does get entangled with photons which are measured on $S\cap S_m$. Thus, if $\{\ket{\gamma_j^{\prime\prime}}:j\}$ are the normalized states representing the possible measurements outcomes of these photons such that $\ip{\gamma_j^{\prime\prime}}{\gamma_k^{\prime\prime}}\approx 0$ for $j\neq k$, then 
$$U_{S_m,S_f} U_{S_f,S_i}\ket{\Phi_{i}}\approx \sum_j c_j\ket{s_j}\ket{a_j}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}\sum_kg_k\ket{\gamma'_k}\ket{\gamma_j^{\prime\prime}}.$$
Since we are assuming that at time $t_m$ a measurement of photons on $S\cap S_m$ is able to determine that the apparatus is in state $\ket{a_f}$, this can only happen if $U_{S_m,S_f} U_{S_f,S_i}\ket{\Phi_{i}}$ is found to be in one of the states $\ket{\Phi_{k,f}}$ for some $k$ where
$$\ket{\Phi_{k,j}}=\ket{s_j}\ket{a_j}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}\ket{\gamma'_k}\ket{\gamma_j^{\prime\prime}}.$$
By the Born Rule, the probability $\ket{\Phi_i}$ will be found to be in state $\ket{\Phi_{k,j}}$ will be
$$\abs{\ip{\Phi_{k,j}}{\Phi_i}}=\abs{c_j}^2\abs{g_k}^2.$$
Therefore,
$$P(f|\ket{\Phi_i})=\sum_k \abs{\ip{\Phi_{k,f}}{\Phi_i}}=\abs{c_f}^2=\abs{\ip{s_f}{s}}^2.$$
Hence, the probability that a complete measurement of $T_S(x)$ on $S$ will give a measurement outcome of the particle being in state $\ket{s_f}$ given the partial measurement of $T_S(x)$ on $S_i\cap S$ determines the particle to be initially in the state $\ket{s}$ will be the same as the standard Born Rule probability $\abs{\ip{s_f}{s}}^2$ of $\ket{s}$ being found to be in state $\ket{s_f}$.

We can also recover this probability using Kent's conditional expectation. To do this, we recall that in standard quantum theory, if for some state $\ket{\psi}$ of a system we define the operator $[\psi]=\dyad{\psi}$, then when the system is in some initial state $\ket{\chi}$, the Born Rule implies that $\ev{[\psi]}{\chi}=P(\psi|\chi)$, where $P(\psi|\chi)$ is the probability that the system will be found to be in state $\ket{\psi}$ given that it was initially in state $\ket{\chi}$. But by (\ref{evev}),  $\ev{[\psi]}{\chi}$ is just the expectation $\ev*{\psi}_\chi$ of $[\psi]$ when $[\psi]$ is treated as an observable. 

Now in equation (\ref{kentconsistency0}), we saw how to calculate the expectation value $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ of the observable $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$ given the notional measurement $\tau_S$ on $S$ outside the light cone of $y$. This suggests that the expectation value of any observable $\hat{O}$ defined at spacetime location $(t_i,z_0)$ given the notional measurement $\tau_S$ on $S$ outside the light cone of $(t_i,z_0)$ is going to be
$$\ev*{\hat{O}}_{\tau_S}=\frac{\ev*{\pi_i\hat{O}}{\Psi_i}}{\ev*{\pi_i}{\Psi_i}}.$$ 
By (\ref{piphi}), $\ev*{\pi_i}{\Psi_i}=\abs{c}^2$, and so taking $\hat{O}$ to be $[s_f]$ we have 
$$ \ev*{[s_f]}_{\tau_S}=\frac{\abs{c}^2\abs{\ip{s_f}{s}}^2}{\abs{c}^2}=\abs{\ip{s_f}{s}}^2.$$
Thus, Kent's conditional expectation $\ev*{[s_f]}_{\tau_S}$ gives us the same probability $\abs{\ip{s_f}{s}}^2$ for a particle transitioning from state $\ket{s}$ to state $\ket{s_f}$ as in standard quantum theory.

Also note that we can typically expect the $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}$-state to be independent of the $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}$-state. Therefore, since $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A})}}$ will determine the measurement choice, and since $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{S})}}$ determines the initial state of the particle, we can expect the state of the particle to be independent of the measurement choice in Kent's theory. Thus, we can fulfil one of the necessary criteria (i.e. criterion \ref{hidden2}) for PI to be a well-defined notion.

\section{Kent's Theory and Parameter Independence\label{kentpi}}
In addition to criterion \ref{hidden2} being satisfied, criterion \ref{hidden5} must also be true if PI is to be a well-defined notion. In the previous section, we saw how we can generalize Kent's beable $\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ to calculate conditional expectations $\ev*{\hat{O}}_{\tau_S}$ for any observable $\hat{O}$ defined at a particular spacetime location $(t_i, z_0)$. Calculating the probability for two measurements requires calculating the conditional expectation of an observable that depends on two spacetime locations. In order to do this, we need to make a further adaption to Kent's theory. In this section, we will describe this adaption and show that with it, Kent's theory allows us to calculate probabilities for Bell-type experiments, and that these probabilities are the same as in standard quantum theory. Since PI holds in standard quantum theory,  a consequence of Kent's theory agreeing with standard quantum theory is that PI will also hold in Kent's theory.


So let's consider figure \ref{bellsolution} which depicts a one-dimensional view of a Bell-type experiment.

There is a left wing of the experiment located in the vicinity of $z_L$, and a right wing of the experiment located in the vicinity of $z_R$. Shortly before time $t_i$, photons interact with a Stern-Gerlach apparatus on the left wing and a Stern-Gerlach apparatus on the right wing, with the result that the photons being measured on a spacelike hypersurface $S_{n,i}\cap S$ to be in states $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}$ and $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}$ determine the measurement parameters of the apparatuses on the left wing and the right wing of the experiment respectively. 

We need to adapt Kent's sequences of spacelike hypersurfaces in order to proceed.  Sequences of spacelike hypersurfaces $S_{n,i}$ are chosen so that they all contain the spacetime locations $y_L=(t_i, z_L)$ and $y_R=(t_i,z_R)$, and that in the limit, $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}S_{n,i}$ contains as much of $S^1(y_L)$ and $S^1(y_R)$ as possible, where as usual, $S^1(y)$ denotes the subset of $S$ lying outside the light cone of $y$. Ultimately, this limit (unlike the limit of Kent's spacelike hypersurfaces) will not contain the whole of $S^1(y_L)$ or $S^1(y_R)$, but only serves to guarantee that we use as much of the information in $S$ as possible in calculating the expectation values of observables at $(t_i, z_L)$ and $(t_i,z_R)$. There will be some degree of freedom in what we choose for the spacelike hypersurface between $(t_i, z_L)$ and $(t_i,z_R)$ as depicted by the dashed line in the figure. However, such freedom will have no effect on the probabilities calculated, because under the assumption that the spacelike hypersurface is very far into the future, there will be no choice of spacelike hypersurface in this region that would give us more information in $S$ to condition on. Also, we recall that the stress-energy operators in the Tomonaga-Schwinger formulation of relativistic quantum physics are chosen so that they are invariant under perturbations of the spacelike hypersurface, so under the assumption that all physical observables will be ultimately expressible in terms of the stress-energy operators, the arbitrary choice of the spacelike hypersurfaces in regions that can't intersect with $S$ will have no effect of the probabilities calculated. 

On the spacelike hypersurface $S_{n,i}$, we assume that there are some photons ``measured'' on it to be in the states $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}$ and $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}$ that determine the choice of measurement axes for the left and right wings of the experiment respectively.  We assume that the axis of orientation of the right wing Stern-Gerlach apparatus makes an angle $\theta$ with the axis of the left wing apparatus.

We also assume that there are two particles that together form a Bell-state \begin{equation}\label{bellstatePI}
	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_L\ket*{\uvbm{s}}_R-\ket*{\uvbm{s}}_L\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_R).
\end{equation}
We saw  in footnote \ref{bellstate2pf} on page \pageref{bellstate2pf} that a Bell state does not depend on the orientation of $\uvb{s}$, so without loss of generality, we can suppose that the $\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_L$ and $\ket*{\uvbm{s}}_L$ are pointer states for the apparatus on the left-wing of the experiment. This means there will be a ready state $\ket{a}_L$  as well as two states $\ket{a+}_L$ and $\ket{a-}_L$ of the left wing apparatus such that 
$$\ket*{\uvbpm{s}}_L\ket{a}_L\rightarrow\ket*{\uvbpm{s}}_L\ket{a\pm}_L.$$

As for the right wing of the experiment, we let  $\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R$ and $\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta-}}_R$ be pointer states for the apparatus so that there is a ready state $\ket{a}_R$  as well as two states $\ket{a_\theta+}_R$ and $\ket{a_\theta-}_R$ of the right wing apparatus such that 
$$\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}}_\theta\pm}_R\ket{a}_R\rightarrow\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}}_\theta\pm}_R\ket{a_\theta\pm}_R.$$
As in approximation (\ref{phii}), the detections of the photons on $S_{n,i}\cap S$ being in state $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}$ and $\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}$ determine the two particles and the apparatuses on both wings of the experiment to be in the state 
\begin{equation}\label{bellstatePI2}
	\ket{\Phi_i}\approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_L\ket*{\uvbm{s}}_R-\ket*{\uvbm{s}}_L\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_R)\ket{a}_L\ket{a}_R\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}.
\end{equation}
As in equations (\ref{spintrans1}) and (\ref{spintrans2}), we have
\begin{align*}
\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_R&= \alpha_\theta\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R+\beta_\theta \ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta-}}_R,\\
\ket*{\uvbm{s}}_R&= \alpha_\theta\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta-}}_R-\beta_\theta \ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R,
\end{align*}
where $\alpha_\theta=\cos(\theta/2)$, and $\beta_\theta=\sin(\theta/2).$
Substituting this into (\ref{bellstatePI2}), we can express the state of the two particles as
\begin{equation}\label{bellstatePI3}
	\begin{split}
	\ket{\Phi_{n,i}}&\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\alpha_\theta\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_L\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta-}}_R
	-\beta_\theta\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_L\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R\\
	&\quad-\alpha_\theta\ket*{\uvbm{s}}_L\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R
	-\beta_\theta\ket*{\uvbm{s}}_L\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta-}}_R)\ket{a}_L\ket{a}_R\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
If we apply the unitary operator $U_{S_{n,m},S_{n,i}}$ to each of the terms of (\ref{bellstatePI3}), we get 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
U_{S_{n,m},S_{n,i}}\ket*{\uvbpm{s}}_L\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta\pm'}}_R\ket{a}_L&\ket{a}_R\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}\ket*{\gamma_i^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}\\
&=\ket*{\uvbpm{s}}_L\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta\pm'}}_R\ket{a\pm}_L\ket{a_\theta\pm'}_R\ket*{\gamma_{m,\pm}^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}\ket*{\gamma_{m,\pm'}^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\ket*{\gamma_{m,\pm}^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}$ are the states of possible detections of photons on $S_{n,m}$ that would determine the left wing apparatus to be in the state $\ket{a\pm}_L$, and where $\ket*{\gamma_{m,\pm}^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}$ are the states of possible detections of photons on $S_{n,m}$ that would determine the right wing apparatus to be in the state $\ket{a_\theta\pm'}_R$.
Using the Born Rule, we therefore see that given a measurement of $T_S(x)$ determines the state of the spacelike hypersurface $S_{n,i}$ to be in state $\ket{\Phi_{n,i}}$,  the probability that the spacelike hypersurface $S_{n,m}$ will be found to be in the state 
$$\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_L\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R\ket{a+}_L\ket{a_\theta+}_R\ket*{\gamma_{m,+}^{(\mathcal{A}_L)}}\ket*{\gamma_{m,+}^{(\mathcal{A}_R)}}$$
will be 
$$\frac{1}{2}\abs{\beta_\theta}^2=\frac{1}{2}\sin^2(\theta/2) $$
From this it follows that the probability that the left wing particle will be in state $\ket*{\uvbp{s}}_L$ and that the right wing particle will be in state $\ket*{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R$ given the initial conditions will also be $\frac{1}{2}\sin^2(\theta/2) $. This is the same probability as that given by standard quantum theory on page \pageref{bellsin}. 

Also note that if we define the observable $[\uvbp{s}]_L=\ket{\uvbp{s}}_L\prescript{}{L}{\bra{\uvbp{s}}}$ that depends on spacetime location $(t_1, z_L)$, and the observable $[\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}]_R=\ket{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R\prescript{}{R}{\bra{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}}$ that depends on spacetime location $(t_1, z_R),$ then we can construct the observable
$[\uvbp{s}]_L [\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}]_R $, and with the adapted sequence $S_{n,i}$ of spacelike hypersurfaces, we can calculate the conditional expectation
$$\ev*{[\bm{\hat{s}+}]_L[\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}]_R}_{\tau_S}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\ev*{\pi_{n,i}[\bm{\hat{s}+}]_L[\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}]_R}{\Psi_{n,i}}}{\ev*{\pi_{n,i}}{\Psi_{n,i}}}.$$
With this adaption and the notional measurement of $T_S(x)$ on $S$ described in this section, it is easy to see that 
$$\ev*{[\bm{\hat{s}+}]_L[\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}]_R}_{\tau_S}=\frac{1}{2}\sin^2(\theta/2)$$ 
which is the joint probability for finding the left wing particle in state $\ket{\uvbp{s}}_L$ and the right wing particle in state $\ket{\bm{\hat{s}_\theta+}}_R$. Thus, we can adapt Kent's model so that criterion \ref{hidden5} of page \pageref{hidden5} is satisfied and such that Kent's model gives the same probabilities as standard quantum theory. Hence, PI holds in Kent's theory.\label{kentpiend}


\section{An Alternative to Kent's Beables}
A final question to consider in this chapter is the nature of Kent's beables. As discussed on page \pageref{beabledef}, Bell hoped for a more satisfactory theory than standard quantum theory. This more satisfactory theory was to be a theory of beables rather than a theory of observables, and these beables would form the underlying reality that gives rise to all the familiar things in the world around us. 

Now in the context of Kent's theory, the definite mass/energy density $\tau_S(x)$ at a location $x\in S$ seems like a good candidate to be a beable. But what is less obvious is what the beables should be for a spacetime locations prior to $S$. Kent seems to be saying that the beables at a spacetime location $y$ prior to $S$ would consist in the stress-energy tensor whose values were given by the conditional expectation value  $\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ for all the different combinations of $\mu$ and $\nu$. 

In some situations, the definite values of $\tau_S(x)$ on $S$ will give rise to $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$-eigenstates at $y$, in which case the conditional expectation $\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ will be identical to a definite value for $T^{\mu\nu}(y)$ as normally understood in standard quantum theory. But there will inevitably be situations in which the definite values of $\tau_S(x)$ on $S$ will not give rise to  $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$-eigenstates at $y$. In ohter words, in the notation defined in section \ref{LorentzInvarianceSection} on page \pageref{tauprojection}, we may find that the state $\pi_n\ket{\Psi_n}$ at $y$ is in a superposition of eigenstates of $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$. But in that case, it seems very dubious to claim that the expectation value $\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ is the true state of reality and hence the beable at $y$. As an analogy, it seems a bit like saying if the throw of a six-sided dice was described quantum mechanically, then the dice could yield a beable of 3.5 for its outcome since 3.5 is the expectation value for the throw of a six-sided dice. In Kent's theory, there would of course nearly always be sufficient information in $\tau_S$ on the spacelike hypersurface $S$  to determine that the dice had an integer outcome between 1 and 6. But this still allows for the remote possibility that this information might not be sufficient. It nevertheless seems unnecessary to insist that  physical reality is so definite that we have to allow for the possibility of a six-sided dice having 3.5 as an outcome. 

One way to avoid such a possibility would be to suppose that there are degrees of definiteness in physical reality. In the context of Kent's theory, one could still suppose that the mass/energy density $\tau_S(x)$ on $S$ was perfectly definite, and that some definite facts about physical reality would flow from the definite facts about $S$. But there would also be much indefiniteness about physical reality. This would occur whenever the information in $\tau_S(x)$ was insufficient to determine whether the state $\pi_n\ket{\Psi_n}$ was an eigenstate of some observable. If light were to interact with the location $y$ in a different way, then this might be able to settle the question of which eigenstate $\pi_n\ket{\Psi_n}$ was in, but this definite outcome would then result in $y$ being indefinite with respect to other observables. But even though there would inevitably be many physical quantities of a system that lacked definiteness, we would still be able to make claims about how mass/energy \emph{might} have been measured on $S$ and hence how likely a physical quantity might have had a particular value corresponding to this possible measurement on $S$.

Another issue that should concern us is the question of what should be the  subject of the beables. Any beable presupposes a subject as well as a property that belongs to the subject. So in the case of Kent's beables, the spacetime location $y$ would be the subject and $\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ would be a property of the subject. However, in section \ref{kentpi} (pages \pageref{kentpi}--\pageref{kentpiend}), we found that in order to deal with joint probabilities in Bell-type experiments, it was necessary to calculate expectation values for observables that depended on two spacetime locations rather than just one spacetime location. 

Now perhaps some people would argue that joint probabilities are not beables and they might therefore conclude that the need to use multiple spacetime locations in determining joint probabilities is irrelevant when it comes to deciding what the subject of a beable should be. But in defense of their relevance, it does seem that joint probabilities are saying something about reality. Moreover, in the absence of hidden variables, these joint probabilities can't be reduced to some more basic reality whose components only depend on  single spacetime locations. It therefore doesn't seem unreasonable to attribute beability to probabilities, and if a probability could count as being a beable, then when that probability depended on more than one location, we would obviously have a beable whose subject consisted in more than one location. 

But there is another reason for allowing beables whose subject  consists in multiple locations, for by allowing this, we can avoid some of the strange consequences that occur if we only allow a  single location to be the subject of a beable. For consider figure \ref{strangesubject}.

We suppose that initially the state of $S_0$ is 
$$\ket{\Psi_0}=a\ket{\psi}_L\ket{0}_R+b\ket{0}_L\ket{\psi}_R$$ 
with $\abs{a}^2+\abs{b}^2=1$ (and where we have omitted all other terms corresponding to other spacetime locations). A photon then interacts with the joint system and is ``measured'' on $S$ to be in state $\ket{\gamma}$ thus determining the mass of the composite system to be located at $z_L$. Now we consider the observable $[\psi]_L$ and suppose its corresponding beable has as its subject a single spacetime location $(t,z_L)$, so that the expectation of $[\psi]_L$ is conditioned on the information in $S_n\cap S$ (taking the limit as $n\rightarrow\infty$ as usual) as depicted in figure \ref{strangesubject} (a). Then as soon as the photon has interacted with the mass centered at $z_L$, we can say that the system has collapsed to this mass center (since the photon will be detected on $S_n\cap S$ when we take the limit as $n\rightarrow\infty$). But if the photon registers at a location on $S$ that is within the light cone of $(t, z_R)$, and we consider the observable $[\psi]_R$ and its corresponding $(t, z_R)$-beable, then there is nothing to condition on in $S$ when calculating the expectation value of $[\psi]_R$, and so we will obtain a non-zero answer for this $(t, z_R)$-beable suggesting that there is some matter/energy at $z_R$ at time $t$, even though according to the $(t, z_L)$-beable all the mass/energy is located at $z_L$ at time $t$. This seems very strange. 

However, if we consider the beable whose subject consists of both $(t, z_L)$ and $(t, z_R)$, then because we have to choose a spacelike hypersurface that contains both $(t, z_L)$ and $(t, z_R)$ as depicted in figure \ref{strangesubject} (b), the system won't collapse to the mass center at $z_L$ as soon as the photon interacts with it. Rather, it will only collapse to this mass center once the photon registered on $S$ is outside the light cones of  both $(t', z_L)$ and $(t', z_R)$ for some $t'>t$. Once this time $t'$ has occurred, $z_L$ and the $z_R$ will no longer be entangled, and so we would be able to consider beables whose subjects were the single spacetime locations at $(t', z_L)$ and $(t', z_R)$.

This suggests we should take all the spacetime locations in an entangled system to be the subject of a beable where entanglement is determined by the information in $\tau_S$ as well as the initial state $\ket{\Psi_0}$. As the initial state evolves, particle interactions and particle spreading will tend to induce entanglement between spacetime locations, but ``measurement'' on $S$ will tend to disentangle spacetime locations. For example, if we have an entangled state of the form
$$a\ket{\psi^a_1}_L\ket{\psi^a_2}_R\ket{\gamma_a}+b\ket{\psi^b_1}_L\ket{\psi^b_2}_R\ket{\gamma_b}$$
then once the $\ket{\gamma}$-state is measured on $S$ outside the light cone of these two locations, then the state will disentangle to either 
$$\ket{\psi^a_1}_L\ket{\psi^a_2}_R\ket{\gamma_a}$$
or 
$$\ket{\psi^b_1}_L\ket{\psi^b_2}_R\ket{\gamma_b}.$$
So with all this entanglement and disentanglement going on, we can expect there to be many different beable-subjects.

In dealing with subjects that contain multiple spacetime locations, the issue of simultaneity needs to be considered carefully, for if all the spacetime locations are simultaneous in one frame of reference, they are not going to be simultaneous in another frame of reference. Moreover, what we deem to be simultaneous in a subject is going to affect which spacelike hypersurfaces $S_n$ contain the subject, and these spacelike hypersurfaces will in turn determine the state $\pi_n\ket{\Psi_n}$ and hence affect what spacetime locations are entangled. Since entanglement is being proposed as the criterion for spacetime locations to belong to the same subject, we therefore need to consider carefully what is the most appropriate frame of reference for the subject such that its spacetime locations are simultaneous. 

A natural candidate for such a frame of reference would be one in which the expectation value of the center of mass of the subject had zero velocity. We still need to be careful, since for greater $n$, the intersection between $S$ and the spacelike hypersurface $S_n$ that contains the subject is going to increase, and so there is typically going to be more  information in $\tau_S$ available to condition on. This additional information could then possibly lead to disentanglement of regions that were previously entangled for  smaller $n$. If such disentanglement occurred, we would then need to choose one of these new (and smaller) entangled regions and choose a frame of reference in which the new entangled region was simultaneous and in which the center of mass of the entangled region had zero velocity. So we would have to proceed in an iterative manner, but one would hope that eventually we would obtain a set of entangled locations that could serve as the natural subject of a beable. Hopefully, the corresponding beables of this entangled system would be Lorentz invariant in a way analogous to the rest mass of a particle being Lorentz invariant.

In addition to specifying what the subject of a beable should be, we would also need to consider what the beable itself should be. A guiding principle in specifying what the beables should be is to think about what the beables would be in the many-worlds interpretation, and then consider in this light what the most natural beables would be when one introduces a spacelike hypersurface $S$ with its ``measured'' value of $T_S$. 

Now proponents of the many-worlds interpretation often speak as though there is nothing more to reality that the universal state $\ket{\Psi}$ of the universe. If this state were to factorize as 
\begin{equation}\label{PhiBeables}
	\ket{\Psi}=\prod_j\ket{\Psi_j}
\end{equation}
 where $\ket{\Psi_j}$ cannot be factorized further, one might be inclined to say that the beables would be the states $\ket{\Psi_j}$ since these states could be specified independently of each other. But as soon as the systems these states described interacted with each other, they would become entangled, and since there is no principle of disentanglement in the  many-worlds interpretation, eventually all systems would get entangled with one another. It would thus seem natural to say there was only one beable in the many-worlds interpretation, namely $\ket{\Psi}$, and that its subject was the whole of physical reality. But once we have a principle by which disentanglement can occur, then we can expect a factorization of $\ket{\Psi}$ as in equation (\ref{PhiBeables}), and we could then deem the $\ket{\Psi_j}$ to be the beables, and the subject of each $\ket{\Psi_j}$ would be the entangled region in spacetime that it described.  

In the context of Kent's theory, I  am thus proposing that the beables would be of two sorts. Firstly, there would be the beables at every spacetime location $x$ of $S$, and the value of each beable would be the  ``measured'' value $\tau_S(x)$ of $T_S(x)$. Here, I am in agreement with Kent. 

Secondly, there would be a beable for every region of spacetime $B$ that satisfied the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  the spacetime locations of $B$ are all spacelike separated from one another,
\item there is a Lorentz transformation under which all the members of $B$ become simultaneous,
\item  if $S_B$ is any spacelike hypersurface that contains $B$, and $S_B$ is tiled with equally sized cells that can serve as a course-graining for $S_B$, then $B$ will consist of a finite number of cells,
\item given a course-graining of $S_B$ in which $B$ consists of $M$ cells, there will be a sequence of spacelike hypersurfaces $S_n$ containing $B$ and corresponding projections $\pi_n$ (as described on page \pageref{tauprojection})  such that for sufficiently large $n$,  $\pi_n\ket{\Psi_n}$ will have an irreducible factor of the form
$$
\ket{\Psi_B}=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}^M} c_{n}\prod_{l=1}^{M}\ket{\xi_{k_{l},n_l}}
$$
where the set $\{k_l:l\}$ indexes the cells of $B$ and where we use the notation of  page \pageref{Sistate},
\item when the Lorentz transformation is applied that makes all the members of $B$ simultaneous,  the center of mass of the region $B$ calculated using $\ket{\Psi_B}$ will have zero velocity.
\end{enumerate}
If these conditions hold, then I propose that $\ket{\Psi_B}$ is the beable with $B$ as its subject. This in contrast to Kent's beable $\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}$ whose subject is the single location $y$.

Given the first kind of beable $\tau_S(x)$, the second kind of beable, $\ket{\Psi_B}$, will not be superfluous, since $\ket{\Psi_B}$ will say something about the manner in which  $\tau_S(x)$ could have been other than it is. For if other photons had interacted with $B$ at different times, the manner in which they interacted with $B$ would depend on $\ket{\Psi_B}$, and from $\ket{\Psi_B}$ we would be able to calculate other possible ``measurements'' of $T_S(x)$ (and their probability) that could have made on $S$.

Despite the possible shortcomings of Kent's account of beables that have been mentioned in this section, Kent nevertheless provides a very valuable interpretation of quantum physics: it is Lorentz invariant, it makes predictions consistent with standard quantum theory, it is an interpretation in which parameter independence holds, and it is a one world interpretation. Since parameter independence holds, Kent's theory is superior to the pilot wave interpretation, and since it is a one-world interpretation, it avoids the absurdities of the many-worlds interpretation. Kent's theory therefore deserves to be taken very seriously as a possible solution to the measurement problem.
