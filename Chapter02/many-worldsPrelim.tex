\section{A preliminary consideration of the many-worlds interpretation}
     At this stage in the line of reasoning, it is too early to resort to a many-worlds interpretation of the Bell state where  the first component corresponds to a world in which Alice detects her particle at location $\uvbp{a}$ and Bob detects his particle at location $\uvbm{a}$, and where the second component corresponds to a world in which Alice detects her particle at location $\uvbm{a}$ and Bob detects his particle at location $\uvbp{a}$. The reason such an interpretation would be premature  is  because as mentioned on page \pageref{bellstate2}, for any other axis $\uvb{b}$, the transformation rules in equation (\ref{spintrans}) imply that
    \begin{equation*}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{a}}_A\ket*{\uvbm{a}}_B-\ket*{\uvbm{a}}_A\ket*{\uvbp{a}}_B)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{b}}_A\ket*{\uvbm{b}}_B-\ket*{\uvbm{b}}_A\ket*{\uvbp{b}}_B).\end{equation*}
    Similarly, given the transformation rules in equation (\ref{spintrans}), we should resist the temptation  to interpret a state of the form $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{a}}+\ket*{\uvbm{a}})$ as representing two worlds, one in which the particle is in the state $\ket*{\uvbp{a}},$ and another in which the particle is in the state $\ket*{\uvbm{a}}.$ For according to equation (\ref{spintrans1}), the much more obvious interpretation is that this state just describes one world in which the particle is in the state $\ket*{\uvbp{b}}$ where the angle between
     the $\uvb{a}$ and the  $\uvb{b}$ axis is $90\degree$.\footnotemark
     
    In order to make a case for a many-worlds interpretation, we need to discuss decoherence theory. Decoherence theory considers how a system interacts with its environment, and it allows us to understand what kinds of measurements can be made on the system. In order to discuss decoherence theory and its relevance to the many-worlds interpretation, we first need to introduce the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics.
