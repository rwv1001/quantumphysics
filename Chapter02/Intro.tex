\chapter{Introduction}
Many ideas in quantum physics are expressed in mathematical terms. I will do my best to avoid unnecessary mathematical jargon, but in order to explain the ideas of this thesis, a certain amount of mathematics is unavoidable. I will endeavor to explain all the mathematical terminology as I go along. However, there will be some sections which may be very challenging to readers who do not have a mathematics or physics background. These sections will be marked with and asterisk *.\label{asteriskmeaning}
