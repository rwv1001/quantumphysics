\chapter{The Measurement Problem and the Many-Worlds Interpretation\label{measprobchap}}
In the previous chapter we discussed the EPR-Bohm paradox which exhibits the mysterious correlations of measurement outcomes made on spin singlets by two different observers. We saw that the standard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics (which posits that upon measurement  an instantaneous state collapse to a definite measurement outcome occurs) must be rejected if one is to accept Einstein's theory of special relatively. Furthermore, we saw that Bell's paradox (that is, the experimental violation of Bell's inequality) implies that a local hidden variables theory must also be rejected. We also discussed Shimony's attempt to resolve Bell's paradox by claiming that as long as the parameters or hidden variables satisfy parameter independence (PI), they will be sufficient to resolve Bell's paradox in such a way that quantum physics and special relativity can peacefully coexist. However, Shimony's solution rests on there being a clear notion of what an outcome is. But the question of what an outcome is and even whether there are such things as measurement outcomes is very controversial. In this chapter, we will explain the nature of this controversy which is an important part of what is known as the measurement problem. 

The measurement problem itself actually consists of three parts: (1) the preferred basis problem, (2) the nonobservability of interference at the macroscopic level, and (3) the problem of outcomes.\footnote{See \cite[50]{Schlosshauer}} 
Decoherence theory is able to resolve parts (1) and (2) of the measurement problem, and following Schlosshauer, we will explain how this is done, but as we will see (also following Schlosshauer), decoherence theory is not able to resolve the part (3) of the measurement problem, the problem of outcomes.

The problem of outcomes arises when we suppose that the quantum state gives a complete description of the system it is describing,\footnote{We need to make a small caveat here -- the example of the quantum states we have described so far such as $\ket*{\uvb{a}}$ and $\ket*{\Psi_{\text{Bell}}}$ only give a complete description of the spin state of a system. These states don't say anything about the position of the system's particles. Nevertheless, we could in principle write down an expression for the state that did include this positional information. We will therefore think of the expressions such as $\ket*{\uvb{a}}$ and $\ket*{\Psi_{\text{Bell}}}$ as abbreviations for quantum states that also include a complete specification of the particle positions which in the context of quantum physics will be a wave function that determines the probability the particles can be detected in a particular region.} and throughout this chapter we will make this assumption. In other words, we will assume there are no hidden variables, whether local or otherwise. 

In this chapter, we will also discuss the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics which attempts to sidestep the problem of outcomes by refusing to acknowledge the reality of outcomes. Although the many-worlds interpretation is mathematically appealing, from a philosophical point of view, it is woefully inadequate. Nevertheless, an understanding of the many-worlds interpretation and how it relates to the problem of outcomes will prove helpful when we come to evaluate Kent's interpretation of quantum physics in the following chapter.
