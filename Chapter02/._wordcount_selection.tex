Rather there will at the very most only be a fact of the matter regarding the state of the composite system that includes both the measuring device and the thing being measured.\footnote{In fact, it is questionable whether we can even make a matter of fact claim about there being a measuring device at all -- rather, in the many-worlds interpretation, we can only say there is a superposition of states in which there is a measuring device in existence with respect to some environments, and of states in which there is not a measuring device with respect to other environments.  } Thus, in the many-worlds interpretation, there are no measuring devices satisfying the criteria one would expect a measuring device to satisfy. And so without such measuring devices, it does not appear to be possible to do science according to what we normally mean by science.
