\footnotetext[1]{As mentioned in the introduction on page \pageref{asteriskmeaning}, sections marked with an asterisk may be challenging to readers who do not have a  background in physics.}\label{LorentzInvarianceSection}\renewcommand*{\thefootnote}{\arabic{footnote}}If we are to take Kent's theory seriously, it should be just as good at making predictions as standard quantum theory, and it had better not contradict empirical observations. Over the last century, standard quantum theory has been firmly established scientifically, and so far, it has not been contradicted by any experimental observations. Standard quantum theory allows us to form a quantum state description of a physical system based on how the system was set up in an experimental environment, and then Schr\"{o}dinger's equation can be used to evolve this state forwards in time, and finally, we can calculate expectation values for various physical quantities belonging to this physical system, and these agree with the average values measured on the system when the experiment is performed many times. In other words, standard quantum theory is \textbf{empirically adequate}\index{empirical adequacy!informal definition}\footnote{See p. \pageref{adeq} for a more formal definition of empirical adequacy.} in its domain of applicability. Thus, if we can show that Kent's theory is just as good at making predictions as standard quantum theory, then it too will be empirically adequate to the same degree. This doesn't necessarily mean that Kent's theory will make exactly the same predictions as standard quantum physics, for the additional information that Kent's theory requires beyond standard quantum theory may alter these predictions. Indeed, if this additional information made absolutely no difference to the predictions of standard quantum theory, then it would seem rather redundant. But we should nevertheless be able to derive the predictions of standard quantum theory from Kent's theory by averaging over the unknown variables that describe the additional information in Kent's theory. 

In order to show that Kent's theory is just as good as standard quantum theory, we recall the preliminary calculation of $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ given in section \ref{kentcalculation}:
\begin{equation}\tag{\ref{beable1} revisited}
	\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}=\sum_\tau P(q(\tau) | r(\tau_S,y))\tau=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_\tau\frac{P(q(\tau) \, \& \, r_n)\tau}{P(r_n)}.
\end{equation}
We proceed to calculate $P(r_n)$ and $P(q(\tau)\, \& \,r_n)$ in order to calculate  $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$. We first note that since $S_n$ is a hypersurface,   there will exist a unitary operator $U_{S_nS_0}$ defined by equation (\ref{SchwingerUnitaryOP}) which maps the Hilbert space\footnote{The Hilbert space $H_S$ for any hypersurface $S$ is defined on page \pageref{HSdef}.} of states $H_{S_0}$ describing $S_0$ to the Hilbert space of states $H_{S_n}$\label{HSidef} describing $S_n$ in accord with how the states of $H_{S_0}$  evolve over time. Now let $H_{S_n,\tau_S}\label{HStau}\subset H_{S_n}$ be the subspace of states $\ket{\xi}$ for which  $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\xi}=\tau_S(x)\ket{\xi}$  for all $x\in S_n\cap S$, and  let $\{\ket{\xi_1},\ket{\xi_2},\ldots\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$. Given that the initial state of the world is $\ket{\Psi_0}$, the probability $P(r_n)$ of ``measuring'' the value of $T_S(x)$ on $S_n\cap S$ to be $\tau_S(x)$ will be 
\begin{equation}\label{Pri}
P(r_n)=\sum_j \abs{ \ip{\xi_j}{\Psi_n}}^2,
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\Psi_n}=U_{S_nS_0}\ket{\Psi_0}$, and this probability will be independent of the particular orthonormal basis  $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ of $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$.\footnote{To see why this is, we note that we can extend the orthonormal set $\{\ket{\xi_1},\ket{\xi_2},\ldots\}$ to an orthonormal basis  $\{\ket{\xi_1},\ket{\xi_2},\ldots\}\cup\{\ket{\zeta_1},\ket{\zeta_2},\ldots\}$ of $H_{S_n}$ which consists entirely of $\hat{T}_S(x)$-eigenstates for all $x\in S_n\cap S$. We can think of each of the states of this orthonormal basis as the possible measurement outcomes when making the notional measurement of $T_S(x)$ on $S_n\cap S$. By the Born Rule, it therefore follows that $P(r_n)=\sum_j \abs{ \ip{\xi_j}{\Psi_n}}^2$. But to see that this probability is independent of the particular basis, we can uniquely write $\ket{\Psi_n}$ as a sum $\ket{\Psi_n}=\ket{\xi}+\ket{\zeta}$ where $\ket{\xi}$ belongs to the span of $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ and $\ket{\zeta}$ belongs to the span of $\{\ket{\zeta_j}:j\}$.  Then since $\ket{\xi}=\sum_j\ip{\xi_j}{\Psi_n}\ket{\xi_j}$, it follows that $$\ip{\xi}{\xi}=\sum_j\abs{ \ip{\xi_j}{\Psi_n}}^2=P(r_n).$$ Therefore, since  $\ip{\xi}{\xi}$ is independent of the particular basis chosen of $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$, so is $P(r_n)$.  \label{priproof} } If we define 
\begin{equation}\label{tauprojection}
\pi_n=\sum_j\dyad{\xi_j},
\end{equation}
then it is easy to see that
\begin{equation}\label{Prn}
	P(r_n)=\ev*{\pi_n}{\Psi_n}.
\end{equation}
We also see that $\pi_n$ is Hermitian (i.e. has real eigenvalues) and that $\pi_n \pi_n = \pi_n$. Any Hermitian operator $\pi$ with $\pi^2=\pi$ is called a \textbf{projection}\index{projection}. We thus see that $\pi_n$ is a projection.

Turning to the calculation of $P(q(\tau)\, \& \, r_n)$, note that for the Tomonaga-Schwinger formulation of relativistic quantum physics, the operators $\hat{T}_S(x)$ and $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$ for fixed $\mu,\nu$ commute when $x$ and $y$ are spacelike-separated. It therefore follows that we can express any state of $H_{S_n}$ as a superposition of simultaneous eigenstates of $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$ and $\hat{T}_S(x)$ for $x\in S_n\cap S$.\footnote{We make the same approximation as depicted in figure \ref{tauSapprox} on page \pageref{tauSapprox}.}  For a particular choice of $\mu,\nu$, we can then form an orthonormal basis $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$ of $H_{S_n}$ consisting of simultaneous $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$, $\hat{T}_S(x)$-eigenstates so that $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau^{(j)}\ket{\eta_j}$ and $\hat{T}_{S}(x)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau_S^{(j)}(x)\ket{\eta_j}$ for $x\in S_n\cap S$, where $\tau^{(j)}$ and $\tau_S^{(j)}(x)$ are the corresponding eigenvalues. If we define  $\pi_{n,\tau}=\sum_j\dyad{\chi_{j,\tau}}$ where $\{\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}:j\}$ is the subset of $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$ such that $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}=\tau\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}$ and $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}=\tau_S(x)\ket{\chi_{j,\tau}}$ for all $x\in S_n\cap S$, then 
\begin{equation}\label{pqtauri}
P(q(\tau)\, \& \,r_n)=\sum_j \abs{ \ip{\chi_{j,\tau}}{\Psi_n}}^2=\ev*{\pi_{n,\tau}}{\Psi_n}.\protect\footnotemark
\end{equation}
\footnotetext{The proof of this is very similar to the proof given in footnote \ref{priproof}.}But if we define $\pi_\tau=\sum_j\dyad{\eta_{j,\tau}}$ where $\{\ket{\eta_{j,\tau}}:j\}$ is the subset of  $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$ with $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)\ket{\eta_{j,\tau}}=\tau\ket{\eta_{j,\tau}}$, then we also have  $\pi_{n,\tau}=\pi_n\pi_\tau$.\footnote{To see why this is, 
we first show that $\pi_n=\sum_j\dyad{h_{n,j}}$ where $\{\ket{h_{n,j}}:j\}$ is the subset of $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$  for which $\ket{h_{n,j}}\in H_{S_n,\tau_S}$. 
Note that $\pi_n\ket{h_{n,j}}=\ket{h_{n,j}}$    since $\{\ket{\xi_j}:j\}$ is a basis for $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$ and $\ket{h_{n,j}}\in H_{S_n,\tau_S}$. 
Therefore, $\pi_n\pi_{n,h}=\pi_{n,h}$  where  $\pi_{n,h}=\sum_j\dyad{h_{n,j}}$. 
But  $\pi_{n,h}\ket{\xi_j}=\ket{\xi_j}$ since $\{\ket{h_{n,j}}:j\}$ is a basis for $H_{S_n,\tau_S}$ and $\ket{\xi_j}\in H_{S_n,\tau_S}$. 
Therefore, $\pi_{n,h}\pi_n=\pi_n.$ But $\pi_{n,h}\pi_n= \pi_n\pi_{n,h}$ since $\pi_n$ and $\pi_{n,h}$ are Hermitian. Hence, $\pi_n= \pi_{n,h}$. Now the summands of $\pi_n\pi_\tau$ are only going to consist of those $\dyad{\eta_j}$ for which $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau\ket{\eta_j}$ and for which $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau_S(x)\ket{\eta_j}$ for all $x\in S_n\cap S$, and these are just the $\dyad*{\chi_{j,\tau}}$ which are the summands of  $\pi_{n,\tau}$. Hence,  $\pi_n\pi_\tau=\pi_{n,\tau}.$} 
  Hence,
\begin{equation}\label{pqtauri2}
P(q(\tau)\, \& \, r_n)=\ev*{\pi_n\pi_\tau}{\Psi_n}.
\end{equation}
But clearly $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)=\sum_\tau \tau \pi_\tau.$ Therefore, combining (\ref{beable1}), (\ref{Prn}), and (\ref{pqtauri2}), we have 
\begin{equation}\label{kentconsistency0}
\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\sum_\tau \ev*{\pi_n\pi_\tau}{\Psi_n}\tau}{\ev*{\pi_n}{\Psi_n}}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\ev*{\pi_n\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_n}}{\ev*{\pi_n}{\Psi_n}}.
\end{equation}
We are now in a position to show that Kent's theory is consistent with standard quantum theory. First let us consider what we need to show. 

In the pilot wave interpretation, its consistency with standard quantum theory requires that if one averages the expectation values of an observable over the hidden variables (i.e. the positions and the momenta of all the particles) then one obtains the expectation value of the observable given by standard quantum theory as indicated in equation (\ref{bohmconsistency}). 

Now in Kent's theory, the hidden variables on which his beables $\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau_S}$ depend are the values $\tau_S(x)$ of $T_S(x)$ for $x\in S^1(y)\cap S$. The operator $\pi_n$ in equation (\ref{kentconsistency0}) in the limit as $n\rightarrow\infty$ encapsulates this hidden information. To remind ourselves of $\pi_n$'s dependency on $\tau_S$ restricted to $S_n\cap S$, we will now write $\pi_n(\tau_{S_n\cap S})$ for $\pi_n$ where $\tau_{S_n\cap S}$ is the function $\tau_S$ restricted to $S_n\cap S$. Likewise, we will write  $r_n(\tau_{S_n\cap S})$ for $r_n$, the statement that $T_S(x)=\tau_S(x)$ for all $x\in S_n(y)\cap S$. If we let $j$ index all possible functions $\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}$ taking real values on $S_n\cap S$,\footnote{Recall that we are implicitly using an approximation scheme described by equation (\ref{tauapproxformula}), so we are really considering functions on the cells of a mesh over $S_n\cap S $ taking values from a finite pool of possible values. Also see footnote \ref{snapprox}. This is why we can use an index $j$ to index all the $\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}.$ } then the analogue of (\ref{bohmconsistency}) requires us to show that 
\begin{equation}\label{kentconsistency}
\ev*{\hat{\bm{T}}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_0}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j}P\big(r_n(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})\big)\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}}
\end{equation}
for all $y$ lying between $S_0$ and $S$, where the left-hand side of (\ref{kentconsistency}) is just the expectation value of $\hat{\bm{T}}^{\mu\nu}(y)$ in the Heisenberg picture as predicted by standard quantum theory.\footnote{Where we are using Schwinger's bold typeface convention as described in footnote \ref{boldref}.} Equation (\ref{kentconsistency}) is sufficient to establish consistency with standard quantum theory because ultimately, all observables are going to be reducible to expressions dependent on $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$, since once we know what to expect for $\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)$, we will know what to expect for the energy and momentum densities for all measuring apparatus readouts etc. and hence what to expect for all measurement outcomes. But from (\ref{Prn}) and (\ref{kentconsistency0}), we have 
\begin{equation}\label{kentconsistency1}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_jP\big(r_n(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})\big)\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j}{\ev*{\pi_{n}(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_n}}
\end{equation}
Since there is an orthonormal basis $\{\ket{\eta_j}:j\}$ of $H_{S_n}$ consisting of simultaneous $\hat{T}_S(x)$-eigenstates so that $\hat{T}_S(x)\ket{\eta_j}=\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}(x)\ket{\eta_j}$ for all $x\in S_n\cap S$, it follows that $\sum_j \pi_{n}(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})=I$. Combining this with (\ref{kentconsistency1}) we get
\begin{equation}\label{kentconsistency2}
	\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_jP\big(r_n(\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S})\big)\ev*{T^{\mu\nu}(y)}_{\tau^{(j)}_{S_n\cap S}}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_n}
	\end{equation}
In the notation of equation (\ref{schwingerformula}), we have $\ket*{\Psi_n}=\ket*{\Psi[S_n]}$, and according to (\ref{schwingerformula}) the expectation value $\ev*{\hat{T}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi[S_n]}$ will be independent of the hypersurface $S_n$ so long as it contains $y$, and the result will be equal to the expectation value $\ev*{\hat{\bm{T}}^{\mu\nu}(y)}{\Psi_0}$ in the Heisenberg picture which is the value that is predicted by standard quantum mechanics. Therefore, equation (\ref{kentconsistency}) follows from (\ref{schwingerformula}) and (\ref{kentconsistency2}) which is what we were aiming to show for standard quantum consistency to hold.
