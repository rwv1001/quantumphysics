% Now your abstract:
 In this dissertation, I will consider in detail the EPR-Bohm paradox and the mysterious correlations that it exhibits, and I will explain why the EPR-Bohm paradox can lead one to think that our best physics suggests a many-worlds picture of reality. I will thus consider the many-worlds interpretation in some detail and explain why it is so attractive. But ultimately, my goal is not to endorse the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, but rather it is to argue that the reasons for endorsing the many- worlds interpretation are not compelling. My argument relies on a recent interpretation of quantum physics by the physicist Adrian Kent. Kent’s interpretation shares several features with the many-worlds interpretation that make it seem attractive, yet in Kent’s interpretation, there is only one world.

I am very grateful to my advisor Dr. Alexander Pruss. It is because of him that I came to Baylor. His encouragement from the moment I first contacted him about doing a doctorate at Baylor has been very important to me in my development as a philosopher. I would also like to thank Dr. Gerald Cleaver who allowed me to do an MA in physics at Baylor and who helped to instill in me a great love for quantum physics. I thank the Dominicans, the religious order to which I belong, and especially my Regent of Studies Fr. Simon Gaine OP on whose recommendation I got permission to undertake doctoral studies. Coming to Texas has been a wonderful adventure, and so I am very grateful for the generous scholarship I received from Baylor University that has made this adventure possible. Being part of the Baylor family has been a great privilege. I have been particularly impressed by how successfully the graduate students and the faculty members of the Baylor philosophy department have cultivated a family atmosphere. I have made so many friends while living in Waco. I am especially grateful to the members of Saint Peter Catholic Center who made me feel so welcome and have done so much to sustain me spiritually. And as always, I express my gratitude to God in whom I live and move and have my being.

% A few suggestions from idk who:

%1. gratitude. you can't thank everyone who helped with your dissertation, your graduate career, and your life, but some folks have gone way out of their way for you. this is a nice opportunity to note their contributions. for me, it was also a nice opening for somewhat cheekily acknowledging the particular debts i owed to those who taught me research skills and values. for example, i mentioned that "To the extent that I've stolen from others, I've probably stolen more ideas from Irv than from anyone else. As I leave Wisconsin, I only wish I had committed more of them to paper."

%2. tone. i favor a more conversational tone for acknowledgements than for the balance of the dissertation, but remember that these pages must nevertheless remain part of the dissertation. try to avoid the sort of slang, profanity, or extreme informality that will look silly in a decade or two.

%3. don't hate, congratulate. unless you are profoundly insensitive, you are certain to be bitter, peeved, dismayed, or chagrined about something that happened during your graduate career. you might be tempted to express these sentiments in the acknowledgements. nevertheless, i'd advise against a paragraph highlighting, say, your fortitude in forging on "despite Professor Uggleson's consistently wrongheaded advice." this sort of thing generally comes off like a teenager's complaint against a well-meaning parent. similarly, the conspicuous exclusion of advisors and committee chairs is akin to dis-inviting a friend to your birthday party. it isn't really appropriate anymore, is it? instead, just let the healing begin.

%4. expand the field. everyone acknowledges their advisors and committee members, as well as their parents and partners. but who else gave real support? when i started thinking big-picture, i knew i couldn't ignore my fine undergrad teachers at the wizversity, great friends from my halcyon days as a social worker, and my beloved softball team. upon deeper reflection, i simply had to acknowledge the influence of paul westerberg, robert merton, bob mould, gore vidal, james coleman, satchel paige, and travis hirschi, as well as "George, Larry, and Flaherty, the police officers who helped me out many years ago, for their judicious and humane discretion." i couldn't have made it without them, that's for sure. 

%5. specificity counts. rather than simply thanking a list of names or categories of people, show how they helped you along the way. did their wicked sense of humor help you bear the pressure of a tough first semester? did they hook you up with the research assistantship that paid off big-time? did they offer emotional support when you seriously considered leaving the business?

%you can draft the acknowledgements early, but I wouldn't circulate them to your committee until after your oral examination. at that point, i'd just run them by your advisor and then insert the pages shortly before you officially file the documents. once you're all approved and filed, you can then deliver a handsomely bound dissertation -- in classic black with gold lettering, of course -- to your committee members and to anyone else who helped out along the way. trust me, they'll appreciate it. and which section do you think they'll read first?
