      Now although a hidden variables interpretation seems rather intuitive, a problem arises when two spin particles are coupled together with each other. This problem is known as the \textbf{EPR paradox.}\footnote{For more details of this problem, see \cite[241-249]{Sakurai}.} To explain how this problem arises, we need to consider two identical fermionic particles that are coupled together. Fermions have the property that no two particles that are coupled together can be in exactly the same spin state. Thus, if we call our fermionic particles $q_A$ and $q_B$, and suppose particle $q_A$ was in the state $\ket*{\uvbp{a},\uvbp{b},\uvbm{c},\ldots}$, then on the assumption that making a measurement on particle $q_A$ has no effect on the state of particle $q_B$, it would follow that particle $q_B$ would be in the  state  $\ket*{\uvbm{a},\uvbm{b},\uvbp{c},\ldots}$. It is thus appropriate to refer to the spin directions describing $q_A$ and $q_B$ as \textbf{local hidden variables}. It seems very natural to assume these  hidden variables are local. 
       
      We now suppose we have an experimental setup so that in each run of the experiment, we have two fermionic particles $q_A$ and $q_B$,  and particle $q_A$ is sent to Alice who measures $q_A$'s spin in a direction of her choosing, and particle $q_B$ is sent to Bob who measures $q_B$'s spin in a direction of his choosing. We assume that in each run of the experiment, Alice and Bob independently measure the spin of their particles along one of three possible directions $\uvb{a}$, $\uvb{b}$, and $\uvb{c}$, and that Einstein's locality principle holds. Furthermore, we assume that in each run of the experiment, the outcome of Alice's measurement will be statistically independent of any of the other measurement outcomes for different runs of the experiment, and for any of the three axes she measures along, she will get a spin up outcome or a spin down outcome with equal probability of $\frac{1}{2}.$ Likewise, we assume Bob's measurement outcomes are also similarly independent between different runs of the experiment. We also assume that the $8=2^3$ states $\ket*{\uvbpm{a},\uvbpm{b},\uvbpm{c}}_A$ exhaust all the possible states for Alice's particles that can be distinguished from one another by one of the three possible measurements she can make. Thus, Alice can distinguish between the $\ket*{\uvbp{a},\uvbp{b},\uvbp{c}}_A$-state and the $\ket*{\uvbp{a},\uvbp{b},\uvbm{c}}_A$-state by making a measurement along the $\uvb{c}$-axis, though if she happened to make her measurement along the $\uvb{a}$ or $\uvb{b}$-axis, she wouldn't be able to distinguish between these two states. But in principle, she can distinguish between these two states if she happens to make her measurement along the right axis, in this case the $\uvb{c}$-axis. We similarly assume the states $\ket*{\uvbpm{a},\uvbpm{b},\uvbpm{c}}_B$  exhaust all the possible states for Bob's particles that he can distinguish between, and we assume that if Alice and Bob measure the particle along the same axis, they will always obtain opposite results from one another. For instance, if Alice's particle is in state $\ket*{\uvbp{a},\uvbp{b},\uvbp{c}}_A$, then Bob's particle must be in state $\ket*{\uvbm{a},\uvbm{b},\uvbm{c}}_B$. Now suppose the experiment is run $N$ times for large $N$,\footnote{$N$ has to be large since a frequentist definition of probability is being assumed.} and let $N_i$ be the number of times particle $q_A$ is in the $i$th state so that\footnote{The notation $\sum_{i=1}^8 N_i$ is shorthand for $N_1+N_2+N_3+N_4+N_5+N_6+N_7+N_8$.} $N=\sum_{i=1}^8 N_i$ as shown in table \ref{hiddentable}.

      \end{table}
       We define $P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{b})$ to be the probability that Alice measures particle $q_A$ to be at location $\uvbp{a}$ on her detection screen and Bob measures particle $q_B$ to be at location $\uvbp{b}$ on his detection screen. We similarly define the probabilities for all other combinations of detection locations. It is relatively easy to calculate all these probabilities in terms of the values $N_i$ from table \ref{hiddentable},\footnote{e.g.  $P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{b})=\frac{N_3+N_4}{N},\, P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{c})=\frac{N_2+N_4}{N},\,P_{AB}(\uvbp{c};\uvbp{b})=\frac{N_3+N_7}{N}$  } or alternatively by simply measuring the frequency of these different outcomes for where Alice and Bob detect their particles. Although the values of $N_i$ are unknown, on the assumption that there is a fact of the matter of which states in table \ref{hiddentable} obtain, and on the assumption that the states to which the $N_i$ correspond exhaust all the possible states for Alice's and Bob's particles, we can show that\footnote{This inequality follows since $P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{b})=\frac{N_3+N_4}{N}\leq \frac{N_2+N_4+N_3+N_7}{N}=P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{c})+P_{AB}(\uvbp{c};\uvbp{b})$.}
       \begin{equation}\label{bellinequality}
      P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{b})\leq P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{c})+P_{AB}(\uvbp{c};\uvbp{b}).
      \end{equation}
      This inequality is known as \textbf{Bell's inequality}, and it follows from Einstein's locality principle.  However, it turns out that when this experiment is actually performed, Bell's inequality is violated. Because of this violation, the most natural conclusion to draw is that it is wrong to suppose that there any hidden variables describing possible spin measurement outcomes. But it also turns out that this violation of Bell's inequality is entirely predictable if we assume that when the two particles $q_A$ and $q_B$ are coupled together, everything that can be said about their spins is encoded in the so-called \textbf{Bell state}: 
      \begin{equation}\label{bell}
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{a}}_A\ket*{\uvbm{a}}_B-\ket*{\uvbm{a}}_A\ket*{\uvbp{a}}_B).\end{equation}
      This state means that if both Alice and Bob measure their particles along the measurement axis $\uvb{a}$, then with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, Alice will detect her particle at location $\uvbp{a}$ and Bob will detect his particle at location $\uvbm{a}$. Likewise, with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, Alice will detect her particle at location $\uvbm{a}$ and Bob will detect his particle at location $\uvbp{a}$. Prima facie, it looks like the Bell state depends on the direction of $\uvb{a}$. However, it can be shown that for any other direction $\uvb{b}$,
      \begin{equation}\label{bellstate2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{a}}_A\ket*{\uvbm{a}}_B-\ket*{\uvbm{a}}_A\ket*{\uvbp{a}}_B)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{b}}_A\ket*{\uvbm{b}}_B-\ket*{\uvbm{b}}_A\ket*{\uvbp{b}}_B).\protect\footnotemark\end{equation}
      \footnotetext{\label{bellstate2pf}To see this, using the transformation rules given in equation (\ref{spintrans}) we have 
      \begin{align*}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{b}}\ket*{\uvbm{b}}&-\ket*{\uvbm{b}}\ket*{\uvbp{b}})\\
            &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}+\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}})(\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}-\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}})\\
      &\quad-(\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}-\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}})(\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}+\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}))\\ 
      &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}-\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}\\
      &\quad+\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}-\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}\\
      &\quad-\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}-\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}}\\
      &\quad+\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}\cos(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}+
      \sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbp{a}}\sin(\theta/2)\ket*{\uvbm{a}})\\
      &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\cos[2](\theta/2)+\sin[2](\theta/2))\ket*{\uvbp{a}}\ket*{\uvbm{a}}-(\cos[2](\theta/2)+\sin[2](\theta/2))\ket*{\uvbm{a}}\ket*{\uvbp{a}})\\
      &=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket*{\uvbp{a}}\ket*{\uvbm{a}}-\ket*{\uvbm{a}}\ket*{\uvbp{a}}).
      \end{align*}}Thus, without loss of generality we can write the joint state of both Alice and Bob's particles as in equation (\ref{bell}), from which it would follow that 
      \begin{equation*}\label{bellsin}
      P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{b})=\frac{1}{2}\sin^2(\theta/2)
      \end{equation*}
      where $\theta$ is the angle between the $\uvb{a}$-axis and $\uvb{b}$-axis.\footnote{To see why this is, let $P_A(\uvbp{a})$ be the probability that Alice would detect her particle at location $\uvbp{a}$ given that she is making a measurement along the $\uvb{a}$-axis, and let $P_{BA}(\uvbp{b}|\uvbp{a})$ be the probability that Bob will detect his particle at location $\uvbp{b}$ given that he is making a measurement along the $\uvb{b}$-axis and Alice has detected her particle at location $\uvbp{a}$. Given that the joint state of the particles is given by equation (\ref{bell}), $P_A(\uvbp{a})=\frac{1}{2}.$ But also note that if  Alice has detected her particle at location  
      $\uvbp{a}$, then Bob's particle must be in state $\ket*{\uvbm{a}}$. From the Born Rule (see page \pageref{bornrule}) and equation (\ref{spintrans1}) it follows that 
      $$P_{BA}(\uvbp{b}|\uvbp{a})= |\ip*{\uvbp{b}}{\uvbm{a}}|^2=\sin^2(\theta/2).$$ 
      Therefore, $$P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{b})= P_A(\uvbp{a})P_{BA}(\uvbp{b}|\uvbp{a})=\frac{1}{2}\sin^2(\theta/2).$$} Then taking the angle between the $\uvb{a}$ and $\uvb{b}$-axes to be $90^\circ$, and the $\uvb{c}$-axis to be at $45^\circ$ to both the $\uvb{a}$ and $\uvb{b}$-axes, we would find that $P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{b})=\frac{1}{4}$ and $P_{AB}(\uvbp{a};\uvbp{c})+P_{AB}(\uvbp{c};\uvbp{b})=0.1464\ldots$, and so Bell's inequality would be violated if we assumed that the probability of each outcome is determined by the Bell state  (\ref{bell}).
