\section{The EPR Paradox}
Things get even more interesting when we perform Stern-Gerlach measurements on pairs of particles. We thus suppose there are two particles $q_A$ and $q_B$. Naively, one would expect that if the spin of $q_A$ were to be measured, then this would have no effect on any measurement outcome for $q_B$. This assumption is a special case of \textbf{Einstein's locality principle}: For two spatially separated systems $S_1$ and $S_2$,  the real factual situation of the system $S_2$ should be independent of what is done to the system $S_1$.\footnote{Einstein expressed this locality principle in his autobiographical notes: ``But on one supposition we should, in my opinion, absolutely hold fast: the real factual situation of the system $S_2$ is independent of what is done with the system $S_1$, which is spatially separated from the former.'' \cite[p. 85]{EinsteinLocality}.} If Einstein's locality principle holds we would be able to attribute a state $\ket{\psi_A}$ to particle $q_A$, and a state $\ket{\psi_B}$ to particle $q_B$. If an experimenter, Alice say, were to perform a Stern-Gerlach experiment on particle $q_A$ then by the Born rule, the probability Alice would find $q_A$ to be in state $\ket{\chi_A}$ would be $|\ip{\chi_A}{\psi_A}|^2$. Likewise, if another  experimenter, Bob say, measured particle $q_B$, then the probability Bob would find $q_B$ to be in state $
ket{\chi_B}$ would be $|\ip{\chi_B}{\psi_B}|^2$. Then independence of Alice and Bob's measurement outcomes would imply that the joint probability of Alice finding $q_A$ to be in state $
\ket{\chi_A}$, and Bob finding $q_B$ to be in state $\ket{\chi_B}$, would be $$|\ip{\chi_A}{\psi_A}|\times|\ip{\chi_B}{\psi_B}|.$$************************************* find measure the particle $q_A$ and find it in state
 The state of the composite system of both particles would then be written as $\ket{\psi_A}\ket{\psi_B}$. If an experimenter, Alice say, were to measure the particle $q_A$, and another experimenter, Bob say, were to measure the particle $q_B$, then
